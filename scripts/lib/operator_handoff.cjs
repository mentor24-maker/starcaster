 * "CC runs the operational commands; handing Dane a command is itself a claim
 * that CC cannot run it" has been written down three times -- 2026-08-07,
 * 08-23 and 08-30 -- and broken three times, twice by sessions that had read
 * the rule that day. A rule that depends on being remembered is not a control,
 * it is a hope. This module is the tripwire, in the same family as
 * check_conventions, check:syntax and the terminology guard.
 *
 * Used by:
 *   - scripts/hooks/check_operator_handoff.cjs   (Stop hook -- refuses the turn)
 *
 * The logic lives here rather than in the hook so the tests can drive the
 * decision directly as well as through the real hook process, the same split
 * as lib/sql_handoff.cjs.

 * Re-measured 2026-09-01 over all 1,615 transcripts in this project, 11,325
 * assistant messages: every-line scanning flagged 151, first-line scanning
 * flagged the same 151, zero newly refused. (Control first: on the three
 * synthetic shapes above the two rules disagree 3/3, so the instrument can
 * tell them apart; the agreement on real messages is a reading, not a dead
 * test.)
 *
 * The reading's REACH is the caveat. All 151 are in `sdk-cli` sessions, which
 * isInteractive() deliberately exempts -- so "zero newly refused" was measured
 * almost entirely where this hook never looks. In `cli`, the only class it can
 * fire in, zero of 884 messages flag under either rule. Both numbers are
 * honest and neither is a licence: the every-line rule is barely exercised by
 * the historical record, so it rests on the synthetic control above, not on a
 * population reading.
 *
 * The one output shape that did read as a hand-off was npm's `>` log prefix,
 * which is why stripPrompt no longer treats `>` as a shell prompt.

 *
 * `cli` DOES NOT MEAN A PERSON IS READING, and an earlier draft of this

 * unattended loop lane: precisely the case the fail-open design is written
 * against.
 *
 * That is survivable rather than fine, and only because of two brakes: three
 * refusals in a session and the wire stands down (see
 * check_operator_handoff.cjs), and `stop_hook_active` exits 0 outright. Do not
