/**
 * `npm run stale-answer` — Dane replied, and nothing moved.
 *
 * The FIFTH watchdog, and it watches the one stage where the thing being
 * waited on is a machine acting on words he has already written. The four
 * before it structurally cannot see this:
 *
 *   heartbeat      did a job stop firing?          the relay was healthy
 *   stale-check    has a job THIS machine owns stopped beating?   it had beaten 9m earlier
 *   throughput     the job fired — did anything come out?         days, not minutes
 *   stale-ready    `Ready to launch` has no owner                 wrong stage
 *
 * On 2026-09-06 Dane answered `C` on 86bbv8nvy at 09:40. The 09:46 relay pass
 * delivered his answer, ran out of ClickUp budget before it could return the
 * ticket to `Queued`, reported that honestly into a bus post the same rate
 * limit skipped, and every later pass read the answer as already relayed and
 * did nothing. He found it himself 3.5 hours later. The retry that stops it
 * being permanent is in `scripts/builder/busRelayPlan.js`; this is the alarm
 * for every other reason the move might still not happen.
 *
 *   npm run stale-answer                        read everything, print the report, write nothing
 *   npm run stale-answer -- --check             the same, and post to the bus if anything is stuck
 *   npm run stale-answer -- --check --dry-run   say what it WOULD post, send nothing
 *   npm run stale-answer -- --force             ignore the read throttle
 *
 * Exit codes, because scripts branch on this:
 *   0  nothing is stuck
 *   1  at least one answer of his has gone unacted on
 *   2  CANNOT TELL: a reading the verdict needed could not be taken. NEVER
 *      rendered as healthy (docs/DOCTRINE.md 3.11)
 *
 * WHERE IT RUNS. `scripts/run_bus_relay.sh` calls it BEFORE the ownership
 * check, beside its four neighbours — and here the neighbours' own reasoning
 * DOES apply, unlike stale-ready's: the failure being watched for is the relay
 * itself not completing the move, so a check that ran only where the relay
 * runs could not see the case where the relay is dead. The machine that does
 * not own the relay is already awake there doing nothing, and that idle wake
 * is the vantage point that survives the owning machine being off.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE MAY FAIL THE JOB THAT CALLS IT. run_bus_relay.sh guards the
 * call with `|| true`, exactly as it does its neighbours'.
