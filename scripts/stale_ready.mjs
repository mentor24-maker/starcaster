/**
 * `npm run stale-ready` — a ticket stuck in `Ready to launch`, and WHOSE hands
 * it actually needs.
 *
 * The third watchdog, and it answers a question the other two structurally
 * cannot. `npm run heartbeat` asks "did a job stop firing?". `npm run
 * throughput` asks "the job fired, and did anything come out?". Both are about
 * the machines. This one is about a single stage that has no owner at all:
 * `Ready to launch` is operator-held, the loops never touch it on purpose, and
 * the merge step re-declines a red PR forever without ever escalating.
 *
 * 86bbkw1mn sat there for six days with Dane's approval already given, blocked
 * on one failing test out of 1,846. PR #444 the day before was the same shape.
 * The full story, and the reason the ACTOR matters more than the alarm, is in
 * lib/staleReady.js.
 *
 *   npm run stale-ready                        read everything, print the report, write nothing
 *   npm run stale-ready -- --check             the same, and post to the bus if anything is stuck
 *   npm run stale-ready -- --check --dry-run   say what it WOULD post, send nothing
 *   npm run stale-ready -- --force             ignore the hourly read throttle
 *
 * Exit codes, because scripts branch on this:
 *   0  nothing is stuck
 *   1  at least one ticket is stuck — whoever it turns out to be on
 *   2  CANNOT TELL: a reading the verdict needed could not be taken. NEVER
 *      rendered as healthy (docs/DOCTRINE.md 3.11)
 *
 * WHERE IT RUNS, AND WHY THAT WAS A DECISION.
 *
 * scripts/run_bus_relay.sh calls this BEFORE it asks whether it owns the
 * relay, alongside the heartbeat and throughput checks — but NOT by inheriting
 * their reasoning, which does not apply here. Theirs is "a watchdog that runs
 * only where its job runs cannot notice that machine being switched off". This
 * check watches ClickUp and GitHub, not a machine, so that argument is not
 * available to it.
 *
 * The reason it belongs there anyway is row 2 of its own table: *approved,
 * green, and still not merged* is precisely what a dead merge step looks like.
 * A check that only ran where the loops run could not see the case where the
 * loops are not running at all — the same blind spot in a different costume.
 * The non-owning machine's idle wake is the vantage point that survives that,
 * so it is where the reading is taken.
 *
 * KNOWN RESIDUAL, STATED RATHER THAN DISCOVERED: the suppression stamps are
 * local to each machine, so once BOTH machines carry the relay schedule the
 * same finding can be posted twice. That is the residual the heartbeat and
 * throughput checks already carry in the same position, and a duplicate on the
 * bus is a far cheaper failure than a silence. Today only the Mini has the
 * schedule installed, so it cannot happen yet.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE MAY FAIL THE JOB THAT CALLS IT. run_bus_relay.sh guards the
 * call with `|| true`, exactly as it does its two neighbours'.
