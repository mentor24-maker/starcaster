// unreachable: the three weekly-report files made the tree read as dirty, so
// the update was skipped with "uncommitted changes present" and the
// fast-forward that would have NAMED them was never attempted. It is also why
// the machine could not repair itself — the recoverable case was being
// treated as somebody's work in progress.
//
// The unit tests above all passed, because they feed `dirty` and
// `mergeStderr` in as independent readings. Only running it against a real
// reproduced checkout showed the two are not independent in the wild.
