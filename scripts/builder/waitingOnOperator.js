/**
 * "Is this actually waiting on Dane?" — derived from live facts, never from
 * an impression.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-23, task 86bbk34x7). Twice in one evening an agent
 * told the operator something was waiting on him when it was not, and he acted
 * on it both times:
 *
 *   - "Seventeen Ready-to-launch tickets are waiting on your merge word."
 *     Eleven already carried his approval and were stuck on a machine that
 *     could not push to GitHub. He went looking for work that was not his.
 *   - "The YouTube worker decision is the one thing waiting on you." He had
 *     answered `A` an hour earlier; the relay had already cleared his name and
 *     moved the ticket to Queued. He asked whether he had to answer a third
 *     time.
 *
 * Neither was a lie and neither was a reasoning failure. Both were A CLAIM
 * ABOUT CURRENT STATE, STATED FLATLY, BY AN AGENT READING SOMETHING OTHER THAN
 * THE STATE — a terminal buffer in one case, a stale impression of a list in
 * the other. The authoritative answer was one API call away each time.
 *
 * Him, that night: "The issue is making assumptions and stating them with
 * confidence. It has come up many times."
 *
 * A RULE ALONE WOULD NOT HOLD. Every claim that was RIGHT that evening carried
 * its evidence welded on ("854/854, verified by read-back"; "exit 0, here is
 * the output"). Every claim that was WRONG was a confident sentence with
 * nothing attached. The discipline is obvious in hindsight and lost every
 * time, because asking the question costs a thought and answering it costs a
 * command nobody has to hand. So: make the cheapest path the correct one. One
 * command, faster to run than the claim is to reason about.
 *
 * This module is the verdict, and only the verdict — no network, no clock, no
 * writes. clickup_direct.mjs does the live reads and hands the raw shapes in.
