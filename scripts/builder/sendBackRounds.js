/**
 * sendBackRounds — how many times has this ticket been sent back, and is the
 * loop stuck?
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-25, task 86bbmg2tq). Dane, watching a ticket bounce
 * to `Queued` for the third time: "I would think tasks would never go back to
 * queue except for situations involving dependencies or time delays."
 *
 * He was pointing at a real modelling problem. `Queued` holds two different
 * things — work nobody has started, and work that was built, reviewed, and
 * handed back with notes — and from the board they are identical. That
 * conflation is not cosmetic: it DEADLOCKED the build loop the same day
 * (86bbm4zwd), because the WIP cap counts open PRs and three of those PRs
 * belonged to tickets sitting in `Queued` for rework, so the cap was blocking
 * the only thing that could close them.
 *
 * He chose the lighter of two fixes: carry the distinction in the Loop note,
 * NOT in a new ClickUp status. (Statuses live on the list, and that dialog has
 * burned this project before.) So:
 *
 *   1. A send-back's Loop note says which round it is and why, in one clause:
 *      `↩ round 3 — three docs now contradict the change (12:28pm)`
 *   2. On what would be round 4, the review pass escalates to Dane instead of
 *      sending back again. Three rounds means the SPEC was wrong, not the
 *      builder; a fourth pass at the same ticket is the system failing to
 *      notice it is stuck. Ticket 86bbk2fuh proved it — it asked to change one
 *      number, turned out to touch four other records, and every round found
 *      something genuinely new.
 *
 * The round is DERIVED, never stored: counted from the verdict comments the
 * loop already writes. No new state means no new state to fall out of sync
 * (the same reasoning as loopTrail — one shape, one writer, one reader).
