/**
 * `npm run repair` — the one repair entry point, and the answer to the
 * question the ticket called load-bearing (2026-09-02, task 86bbtnk3k —
 * audit Phase 4).
 *
 * THE PROBLEM. Four repair tools existed and an operator could not know which
 * to run: `pipeline sweep` (stranded tickets — reachable since this morning,
 * called by nothing), `pass-reconcile` (the loop's own dropped-claim marker),
 * `npm run reconcile` (ClickUp/GitHub drift — "meant to run on a schedule"
 * since 2026-08-18, hand-run ever since), and `resume`'s sweep. A repair
 * nobody runs is the defect that opened the 2026-09-02 stall report, in a
 * new coat.
 *
 * THE SHAPE. Three steps, each CALLED through its own npm script — never
 * re-implemented, exactly the preflight's doctrine — in an order where every
 * automatic write is evidence-based and everything else is a loud report:
 *
 *   marker    `clickup -- pass-reconcile`. The loop's dropped-claim backstop.
 *             Normally the next pass runs this itself; the scheduled repair
 *             exists for the case where there IS no next pass — the runner
 *             dead, the Mini rebooted — and the relay's idle wake is the one
 *             vantage that survives that (the watchdog doctrine). On a
 *             machine with no marker it answers "no claim" and writes
 *             nothing. It is called with `--scheduled`, which is not a
 *             formality — see the step below.
 *   drift     `reconcile -- --check`. Its writes are already automation-safe
 *             by design: it moves a ticket only on hard evidence (its PR
 *             MERGED, ticket in a machine status → Live), FLAGS operator
 *             statuses rather than ever moving them, and reports could-not-
 *             check apart from clean (DOCTRINE 3.11).
 *   stranded  `pipeline -- sweep` — DRY, ALWAYS, in every mode this module
 *             will compose. See below; this is the safety answer.
 *
 * WHY THE SCHEDULED SWEEP NEVER PASSES --apply. A stranded ticket is one
 * sitting in a machine status, untouched past the threshold, with no pass on
 * it. Two kinds of actor produce that state and only one may be repaired
 * unattended:
 *
 *   - a LOOP pass that died. Its claim wrote the pass marker, so the marker
 *     step above already repairs it — within one loop interval by the next
 *     pass, or by this schedule when the runner itself is dead.
 *   - a HAND session (the fast-track lane). It holds a ticket in `Building`
 *     for hours, legitimately, with no marker — five did on 2026-09-02
 *     alone. The marker is the ONLY machine-readable difference between
 *     those two, and no timing threshold can tell them apart: an automatic
 *     `--apply` here would eventually yank a ticket out from under Dane's
 *     own session, which is the one way this feature could do harm.
 *
 *   So unmarked strandings are REPORTED — to the bus, naming the tickets and
 *   the exact command (`npm run pipeline -- sweep --apply`) — and never
 *   moved. The dry run is the finding; a person or an agent session decides.
 *
 * Pure module: step table, dialect readings, post policy, composed outcome.
 * scripts/repair.mjs is the IO.

    //
    // WHY 4 AND NOT 3 FOR "WROTE" (merged 2026-09-04). Two branches gave
    // reconcile's exit 3 a meaning on the same day and the meanings were
    // different: this one made it "Dane has the deck", #593 made it "this pass
    // moved a ticket". Both were right about their own half and shipping both
    // would have left one number meaning two things — a scheduled pass that
    // closed a ticket would have been read as a pass that declined to run, and
    // the REPAIRED it exists to announce would have printed PAUSED. That is
    // the "keep both sides" resolution DOCTRINE 6.7 is about, and it does not
    // announce itself: every gate stays green through it.
    //
    // 3 keeps the decline, because that is the repo-wide dialect every other
    // actor already speaks — `node:owns`, `pipeline -- check`, `clickup claim`,
    // the loop preflight — and reconcile's own stand-down cites it by name. The
    // write gets 4, a number no reader of this file had a prior meaning for.
    //
    // 2 is the lane review round 1 found missing (2026-09-03). Reconcile used
    // to grade an unreadable switch as a pause, so a throttled or unauthorised

    // The 4 is not decoration either (2026-09-04, ticket 86bbuv66c). This step
    // used to have a two-value dialect, and reconcile exited 0 whether it had
    // moved a ticket or not — so the pass that wrongly closed a live urgent
    // ticket printed "REPAIR: CLEAN". A watchdog that cannot report its own
    // writes is narrating, not watching. `composeOutcome` maps 'repaired' to
