/**
 * THE REPLAY. The test the send-back asked for, and the only one that could

 *
 * These are the real pass sequences out of `~/Library/Logs/bus-relay-launchd.log`
 * on the Mini — minutes from the block's first reading, and which of the two
 * wordings GitHub gave on that pass. `null` is a reading that was NOT a
 * cannot-tell, which is what ENDS a block. Nothing here is invented or
 * rounded: every synthetic fixture in this file repeats one string verbatim,
 * and the real log never does, which is exactly why the defect survived eight
 * break-tests.
 *
 * The three long blocks each needed an agent session to unstick. The short one
 * cleared itself in 53 minutes and must stay silent — it is the closest any
 * self-clearing run has ever come to the 90-minute threshold, so it is the
