/**
 * refusalClass — every reason the merge step can refuse for, classified
 * TERMINAL or TRANSIENT at the point it is raised.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-09-03, task 86bbtqpxd). Ticket 86bbqw49y sat in
 * Ready to launch for twelve hours with its work already merged and live,
 * because the thing reporting on it said, twenty-five times, that no looking
 * was required. Every refusal carried the same closing paragraph:
 *
 *   Your approval is still standing — you do not have to say "merge" again.
 *   Every later pass re-checks this ticket, so the moment the reason above
 *   is dealt with it goes through on its own.
 *
 * That paragraph is TRUE of "checks are red" and FALSE of "the PR is already
 * merged". Two thirds of the refusals on that ticket were of the second kind:
 * reasons no later pass could ever clear, wearing a promise that one would.
 * Then the dedup went quiet and the ticket said nothing at all.
 *
 * This is the same shape as the zero-checks deadlock (`docs/DOCTRINE.md`,
 * merge-guard): **the reassurance is what hides the refusal that can never
 * clear.** A refusal repeating forever is at least visible; a refusal
 * repeating forever while promising it is temporary actively recruits the
 * reader into not investigating.
 *
 * THE RULE. A refusal reason is classified where it is RAISED, never inferred
 * later from its wording — wording drifts, and a classifier reading prose
 * would be a second definition of the answer sitting next to the first. Every
 * reason names a code from `REFUSAL_CODES`; every code has an entry here;
 * there is NO DEFAULT. `classifyRefusal` throws on a code it does not know,
 * and `refusalClass.test.js` fails if a code exists without an entry, if an
 * entry exists without a code, or if a `refuse` site in mergeOnComment.js
 * raises without one.
 *
 * THREE CLASSES, NOT TWO:
 *
 *   'transient' — the reason can stop being true, and when it does a later
 *                 pass merges on the operator's original word. This is the
 *                 only class allowed to promise the approval carries over.
 *   'terminal'  — the reason will never stop being true on its own. Somebody
 *                 has to do something, and the message says who and what.
 *   'unknown'   — the gate could not tell. Treated as TERMINAL for messaging:
 *                 a reader who cannot be told to wait must be told to look
 *                 (DOCTRINE 3.11 — "could not check" is never a pass).
 *
 * NAMING THE ACTOR IS PART OF THE CLASSIFICATION (`docs/DOCTRINE.md` §2.5).
 * A terminal message that says "this needs to be dealt with" has named
 * nobody, which is how the twelve hours happened. Every terminal entry's
 * `needs` sentence names `an agent session` or `Dane` out loud, and a test
 * greps for exactly that.
