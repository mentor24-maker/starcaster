/**
 * reviewGate — may this pull request be merged, given what its ticket says?
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-25, task 86bbmfbkv). On 2026-08-25 at 12:38, PR
 * #432 was built and merged to production with no review verdict on its
 * ticket and no merge word from Dane. Ticket 86bbjt1aq went `Live` without
 * ever reaching `Ready to launch`.
 *
 * None of the unattended machinery did it. It was a second Claude Code
 * session on the MacBook running `gh pr merge 432 --squash` — an ordinary
 * session, with ordinary `gh` access, that had no way to know a review lane
 * was waiting for that PR.
 *
 * That is the whole lesson: "loops never merge" is a CONVENTION, and a
 * convention only reaches the actors that know they are bound by it. A fresh
 * session, a forgotten terminal window, an operator in a hurry — none of
 * them are. So the rule stops being something every actor must remember and
 * becomes something the repository enforces, as a required status check.
 *
 * Everything in here is a pure function over data someone else fetched: the
 * PR body, the head commit's timestamp, and the ticket's comments. No
 * network, no `gh`, no ClickUp client — which is what makes every refusal
 * path testable, including the ones that are awkward to reproduce live (a
 * PASS that predates the newest commit; ClickUp being unreachable).
 *
 * The verdict parser is IMPORTED from mergeOnComment, never re-implemented.
 * A gate that disagreed with the merge step about what counts as a PASS
 * would be worse than no gate: it would refuse merges the merge step thinks
 * are fine, or wave through ones it does not. reviewGate.test.js asserts the
 * two agree across a fixture set, so they cannot drift apart later.

 * link back to its ticket, so on loop-built PRs this is reliable; a hand-made
 * PR that skipped that step is exactly the case the gate is here to catch.
 *
 * That premise is now TRUE as written. It was not before 2026-08-26: this gate
 * required a full URL while `pr-opened` ALSO accepted a bare id, so a body that
 * command called traceable could arrive here and be refused for carrying no

 * would have bypassed the gate while looking completely ordinary.
 *
 * So a waiver must sit ALONE on its line, exactly as mergeOnComment anchors
 * its verdict regexes for the same reason: a comment that merely DISCUSSES
 * the words is prose, not an instruction. This anchor covers the sentence and
 * the table cell; the code-block skip in `findWaiver` below covers the other

 * The newest commit that could have changed what a reviewer actually read.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT SIMPLY "the newest commit" (found 2026-08-25 while checking
 * the gate against live PRs, task 86bbmfbkv). Branch protection here is
 * `strict: true`, so a branch must be current with `main` to merge — and this
 * repo catches up by MERGING origin/main in rather than rebasing, on purpose
 * (DOCTRINE §6.6, so a convenience script never force-pushes). Every catch-up
 * therefore adds a commit that is newer than any review.
 *
 * A naive "newest commit" rule made real, correctly-reviewed PRs fail: #406
 * was passed at 14:11 on 08-23 and its three later commits were all
 * `Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/main'`; #400 the same. Enforcing that
 * rule would have deadlocked the whole pipeline — catch up, go stale,
 * re-review, catch up again — which is the exact false-fail the ticket asked
 * to be confirmed absent before switching the gate on.
 *
 * So merge commits are excluded, tested structurally by PARENT COUNT rather
 * than by matching the merge message: a message string is a convention that a
 * future catch-up could word differently, while "has two parents" is what a
 * merge IS.
 *
 * RESIDUAL RISK, stated rather than hidden: a merge commit CAN carry changes
 * of its own, when whoever resolved a conflict wrote new code into the
 * resolution (an "evil merge"). Parent count cannot see that. It is a narrow
 * hole — this repo's catch-ups are performed by a script that refuses to
 * resolve a conflict at all (branchCatchUp), so a conflicted catch-up stops
 * and asks a human rather than committing a resolution unreviewed — and it is
 * far outside the failure this gate exists for. Closing it needs a real diff
 * against the merge base, which is a bigger change than this ticket.
 *
 * A PR made ENTIRELY of merge commits has no "own" commit to measure, so it
 * falls back to the strictest reading — the newest commit of any kind —
 * rather than quietly having no freshness rule at all.

/**
 * What the merge step does with the result of waiting on a re-run.
 *
 * Takes the SHAPE `githubGate` already produces, so nothing here re-decides
 * whether a PR may merge — a green re-run goes back to the merge path, a red
 * one to the refusal path with GitHub's own wording, a conflict to the
 * hand-off.
 *
 * 'update-branch' is the one answer that is neither a pass nor a failure:
 * main moved during the ~3 minutes of waiting, so the branch needs catching
 * up — which the NEXT pass's catch-up path already does, gate re-run
 * included (the push fires `synchronize`). Before this arm existed, that
 * race polled out the full wait and then REFUSED with "the re-run did not
 * clear it" — telling the reader the gate failed when the branch merely
 * fell behind (found in review, 2026-08-30). It maps to a quiet wait, never
 * a refusal and never a merge.
 *
 * Anything else — the wait ran out, the answer was unreadable — is a
 * REFUSAL, never a merge and never a silent wait. Acceptance criterion 4 of
 * task 86bbmk7pv, and the same rule as the gate itself: a re-run whose
 * result nobody saw is not a pass. The refusal is re-decidable, so the next
 * pass merges it on the operator's original word once the re-run has landed.

/**
 * THE GATE'S OWN VOICE — and why it does not say "REVIEW".
 *
 * `mergeOnComment.isReviewVerdict` treats any line beginning with the word
 * REVIEW as a review verdict, deliberately and case-insensitively. The gate's
 * messages used to begin with that word, which meant every single one of them —
 * pass, fail and CANNOT TELL alike — parsed as a verdict, and as a SEND-BACK,
 * since none of them matches the PASSED spelling (task 86bbmmv7t, finding 3).
 *
 * Nothing automated pasted them onto a ticket, so it never bit. But a refusal
 * here is written to tell the reader what to do next, which makes copying it
 * onto the ticket the natural next move for a person or an agent — and doing
 * that would have made the gate's own words the ticket's newest verdict,
 * freezing `readyToLaunchGate`, `mergeDecision` and this gate at once, with
 * the ticket showing a send-back nobody wrote.
 *
 * The fix is to stay out of that namespace: every message this file and
 * `scripts/review_gate.mjs` emit begins with GATE_LABEL, which the verdict
 * parser does not recognise. Exported rather than typed twice so the runner
 * cannot drift back, and a test asserts every real output string reads as no
 * verdict at all.

 * reader's next action is obvious without opening this file.

 *
 * "Warning" here means exit 0, not a red X, and that is a deliberate choice

 * PR carrying a red check. An advisory gate that went red would therefore
 * not be advisory at all — it would silently block every merge the relay
 * makes, through a check nobody had agreed to enforce yet. So advisory mode
 * annotates loudly and exits clean, and enforcing mode is the switch that
 * gives the verdict teeth.
 *
 * The mode comes from the repository variable `REVIEW_GATE_ENFORCING`, set
 * in the same visit as the branch-protection tick. Keeping it a variable
 * (not an inference from "is the token present?") closes the hole in the
 * other direction: with the box ticked, a missing or revoked token yields
 * CANNOT TELL and the gate stays shut, instead of quietly reverting to
 * advisory and waving everything through.
