/**
 * Does this ask cost the operator MONEY, or something he cannot undo?
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-23). An agent escalated to Dane and asked him to
 * spend money on a diagnosis that was wrong. The bus chat channel had been
 * refusing every write for sixteen hours; a custom-field write failed the same
 * day with "Custom field usages exceeded for your plan"; the agent read
 * `GET /team/{id}/plan` back as `Free Forever`, joined the three, and wrote it
 * up with a clean evidence table and three options — option A being "put the
 * workspace back on a paid plan". Confident, well argued, and in his inbox.
 *
 * It was wrong. Re-measured hours later on the SAME token and the SAME
 * unchanged Free plan: chat POST 200 and verified in the channel, custom-field
 * write verified by read-back. The plan was Free before, during and after.
 * Paying would have fixed nothing; the outage was transient and cleared itself.
 *
 * The mistake was not the hypothesis — a plausible correlation on the day two
 * features broke is reasonable. It was that the hypothesis reached the
 * operator's WALLET without anyone re-running the failing call. One command
 * would have settled it, and the escalation was the last moment it was cheap
 * to run and the first moment being wrong was expensive.
 *
 * So the gate is deliberately NOT a checking agent. A general
 * assumption-checker adds a round trip, makes assertions of its own, and burns
 * tokens continuously to catch a class a free rule catches — and the evidence
 * for "assertions of its own" is this very incident, where the agent that
 * produced the wrong diagnosis was already the careful one. This is cheap,
 * narrow and mechanical: it fires only on asks that cost money or cannot be
 * undone, and it demands a command and its output rather than a judgment.
 *
 * Narrowness is the whole value. A gate that fires on every escalation gets
 * routed around, and then it protects nothing — so an ordinary ask (a design
 * question, a scope choice, an A-or-B with no cost) must sail through
 * untouched, and there is a test pinning exactly that.
 */

/**
 * The trigger words, each with the reason it is here. Adding one is a one-line
 * change with a test beside it — that is the contract this list is shaped for.
 *
 * `word` is matched case-insensitively on whole-word boundaries, so `spend`
 * does not fire on `spending` — every form that should fire is listed
 * explicitly rather than stemmed. Stemming is where a list like this quietly
 * grows a reach nobody reviewed.
 *
 * That explicitness has a cost, and it has been paid twice already. The first
 * version carried the base and gerund forms but no THIRD-PERSON ones, and
 * review (2026-08-26) found that "this deletes all 550 rows", "it rotates the
 * key" and "approving this upgrades the workspace" all posted with no evidence
 * at all. The fix added the `-s` forms — and the next review round found the
 * mirror image: `costs` was there and the BASE form `cost` was not, so "this
 * will cost about thirty dollars a month" was silent while "it costs about
 * thirty dollars a month" fired. **When you add a verb, add all three forms**,
 * and add it to the completeness test below the list, which is what actually
 * holds the rule up.
 *
 * PAST TENSE IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT. "We deleted the rows last week" and "the
 * plan was upgraded in July" describe something already done, and a report is
 * not a proposal. The gate fires on what the operator's YES would cause, so
 * base, gerund and third-person are the forms that belong here.
 *
 * `class` is one of:
 *   money         — he is being asked to part with money
 *   plan          — an account or subscription level changes
 *   irreversible  — it cannot be taken back once he does it
 *
 * `needsProposal: true` marks a BARE NOUN — see PROPOSAL_CUES below.

/**
 * The cues that turn a bare NOUN into a proposal.
 *
 * WHY (review round 2, 2026-08-26). `billing`, `invoice`, `deletion`,
 * `rotation` and `migration` name a thing rather than propose an act, so they
 * fired on cards that asked for nothing at all:
 *
 *   "Nothing right now. The billing page renders correctly again."
 *   "Nothing needed — the deletion already happened last week."
 *   "Just confirm you saw the invoice screenshot."
 *
 * All three were REFUSED, which means the agent could not hand the ticket off
 * until it reworded a card that was already correct. AC3's reasoning applies
 * exactly: a gate that fires on everything gets bypassed, and then it protects
 * nothing.
 *
 * A verb needs no cue — proposing IS what a verb does here, which is why past
 * tense is left out of the list above. A noun fires only when one of these
 * cues appears in the SAME sentence, so "approve the deletion", "run the
 * migration" and "authorise the key rotation" all still fire.
 *
 * EVERY CUE CARRIES ALL THREE FORMS — base, gerund, third-person — for exactly
 * the reason the TRIGGERS list does, and it was found the same way. Review
 * round 3 (2026-08-26) put natural inflections through the shipped function
 * and every one of them was SILENT: "proceeding with the deletion of the 550
 * rows", "performing the key rotation on Tuesday", "this executes the
 * migration tonight", "this triggers the migration of every page", "kicking
 * off the migration at 9pm", "signing off on the invoice". Those are ordinary
 * English spellings of exactly the acts criterion 1 names, and they posted
 * with no evidence demanded at all. The completeness test below names the cue
 * families, because the old test only asserted that each LISTED cue fires —
 * which is green while a form is missing, the same blind spot that let the
 * `cost` hole through round 2.
 *
 * PAST TENSE IS ABSENT HERE TOO, and for a sharper reason than on the triggers:
 * adding it would REGRESS round 2's own fix. "Nothing needed — I ran the
 * migration last week" is a report, and a past-tense `ran` cue would refuse it,
 * which is the precise false-positive class that fix was made to close. So
 * "Started the subscription on the paid tier" stays silent by design; it
 * describes something already done, and the gate fires on what a YES would
 * cause.
 *
 * The accepted cost of the third-person forms, said out loud rather than
 * discovered later: a cue can also read descriptively, so "Nothing needed —
 * the migration runs nightly now" fires and has to be reworded. That is the
 * cheap direction. A reword costs one line; silence on a costly ask is the
 * incident at the top of this file.
 *
 * The known limit, stated rather than hidden: a bare noun phrase with no verb
 * at all ("The key rotation — yes or no?") does not fire. The verb forms are
 * the primary net; this list only rescues the noun spellings.
