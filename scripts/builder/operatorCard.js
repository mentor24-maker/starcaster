/**
 * The operator card — the fixed shape of every message a loop puts in front
 * of Dane on a ClickUp ticket.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-22). Until now the loops wrote their reasoning as
 * a long free-form ClickUp comment. ClickUp shows comments in the narrow
 * right-hand column, so the reasoning arrived as a wall of text in the
 * skinniest part of the screen, while the roomy left-hand column held a spec
 * written for a machine. Two tickets stalled on exactly that: Sync 6/7
 * (86bbev0g3) and Sync 7/7 (86bbev0gx). The operator could not tell what was
 * being asked of him on either one, and 7/7 sat in his inbox for a day
 * demanding an answer that was never actually needed.
 *
 * The fix Dane specified: detail goes LEFT (the task description, which is a
 * document and has room), and the right-hand column carries a short card with
 * exactly three parts —
 *
 *   1. his own words, verbatim, that caused the ticket to exist
 *   2. the problem and the fix in plain English, 50-100 words
 *   3. the specific ask, under a banner he can spot without reading
 *
 * The word range is the point of the whole thing. Under 50 words the card
 * stops carrying enough context to act on; over 100 it becomes the wall of
 * text this replaces. So it is checked, not suggested — see validateCard.
 *
 * Pulled out of clickup_direct.mjs so the shape is testable without a network
 * or a token, the same way busRelayPlan.js is.

/**
 * CLICKUP EATS BLOCKQUOTES (found live, 2026-08-22, while testing this very
 * module). A comment posted through `POST /task/{id}/comment` comes back with
 * every `> quoted line` **deleted** — not unformatted, gone. The comment as a
 * whole is still non-empty, so a length check calls it a success. The first
 * two cards this module ever posted lost the operator's own words that way,
 * which is the single part of a card that cannot be reconstructed.
 *
 * A probe of six forms against the live API (task 86bbgm68r): fenced blocks,
 * bold-italic, four-space indents, plain quotation marks and bold-with-dash
 * all survive intact. `>` is the only casualty. So the operator's words go in
 * a fence — which is also the only form that guarantees nothing INSIDE them is
 * reinterpreted, and verbatim is the contract — and `validateCard` refuses a
 * `>` anywhere, in any section. DOCTRINE 3.10: a write that normalizes to
 * nothing looks exactly like a success, so it gets checked, not assumed.
 *
 * **Task DESCRIPTIONS do it too**, checked separately the same day: the
 * "## Dane asked for" section of the first rewritten ticket came back with the
 * quoted instruction gone. So `findBlockquoteLines` is exported and the
 * `describe` command refuses a body containing one, for the same reason.

 * WHY IT IS DECLARED AND NOT INFERRED (Dane's decision, 2026-08-29, option A

 * the author's sentences, and each picked it by a different positional rule:

 * cue-governed clock (round 3), the clock a cue introduces (round 4). Every
 * one of them was right on the sentences it was tested against and wrong on
 * the next one somebody wrote. The last version dated a card
 *
 *   **THE CHECK BEHIND THIS ASK — measured at 3:12pm**
 *
 * from the sentence "At 8:04pm I re-ran the failing call, well after the
 * outage began at 3:12pm" — the moment the outage STARTED, asserted to the
 * operator as the moment it was checked. That is the exact half of the
 * 2026-08-23 incident this timestamp exists to close, arriving through the
 * machinery meant to close it, and it did not refuse: it stated it plainly.
 *
 * The ticket's own Non-goals say this gate stays "cheap, narrow, and
 * mechanical" and does not take on reasoning tasks. Reading which clock in an
 * English sentence is the measurement is a reasoning task, and an open-ended
 * one — a fifth positional rule would have closed that shape and left the next
 * one open, which is what the four before it each did.
 *
 * So the writer says it, on one line, and nothing is guessed. The cost is one
 * line per costly ask. What it buys is that this class of bug cannot recur:
 * there is no sentence shape left to get wrong.
 *
 * It is a line rather than a `@@MEASURED` section because the section markers
