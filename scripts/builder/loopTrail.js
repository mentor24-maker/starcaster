/**
 * loopTrail — the two written traces the loop leaves on a ticket, and the
 * checks that they actually got left.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-22, task 86bbjt18r). Merge-on-comment works, but
 * draining the Ready-to-launch backlog on 2026-08-22 found two ways an
 * approved ticket stalls that have nothing to do with judgement:
 *
 *   - Four tickets had no `PR opened:` comment at all, so the merge step
 *     correctly refused to guess which PR it was about. Two of those PRs also
 *     carried no ClickUp link in their body, so the ticket and its PR could
 *     only be matched by reading titles. The audit trail broke in BOTH
 *     directions at once.
 *   - Two tickets sat in `Ready to launch` — the operator's "safe to merge"
 *     signal — with no passing review verdict recorded on them. He approved
 *     both in good faith. A ticket reaching that status unreviewed is worse
 *     than a ticket stuck.
 *
 * The common cause is that both traces were prose in a skill file: a step
 * that says "add a ClickUp comment with the PR URL" is followed most of the
 * time, and nothing notices the times it is not. So both are commands now
 * (`clickup pr-opened`, `clickup verdict`), each writing a shape this module
 * defines and reading it back through the SAME parser the consumer uses —
 * `mergeOnComment.findPullRequest` and `mergeOnComment.isReviewPassed`. A
 * comment that the merge step could not act on is a comment this module
 * refuses to call written.

/**
 * Can this ClickUp response even ANSWER "is the trail already here"?
 *
 * WHY THIS IS SEPARATE FROM prTrailLanded (2026-08-31, task 86bbq7z1k, round 3).
 * The `--if-missing` preflight read `json.comments || []`, so a 200 whose body
 * carried no `comments` list collapsed to an empty array — indistinguishable
 * from a ticket that genuinely has no trail on it. The guard then wrote, which
 * is a DUPLICATE `PR opened:` line: precisely what `--if-missing` exists to
 * prevent (acceptance criterion 2). An idempotence guard that cannot read fails
 * OPEN, which is the wrong direction; a duplicate is permanent and confusing,
 * while refusing costs one re-run.
 *
 * Observed live on this very ticket: two identical `pr-opened --if-missing`
 * calls eleven minutes apart, the first skipping correctly and the second
 * posting a second line. The one-off itself could not be reproduced — repeated
 * polling and a post-then-read-immediately probe both came back consistent — so
 * this is not a claim about what happened. It is the only path in the command
 * that turns a healthy-looking response into that exact symptom, and it should
 * not exist either way (DOCTRINE 3.11: a check that could not run never reports
 * a pass).
 *
 * An EMPTY array is readable and means "no trail" — that is a real answer, and
 * a ticket with no comments must still be writable. Only a missing or non-array
 * `comments` is CANNOT TELL.
