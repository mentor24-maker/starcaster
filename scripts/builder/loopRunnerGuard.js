/**
 * What should the loop runner do about a pass that died on a usage limit?
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-09-02, task 86bbtuje2 — audit Phase 1). Between 2:05
 * and 2:50am the build loop fired three passes. Each died in seconds on
 *
 *   You've hit your session limit · resets 2:50am (America/Denver)
 *
 * and each time the runner slept its fixed 900s and retried into the same
 * closed window, blind. The message NAMES the reset time; nothing read it.
 *
 * This module is the reading. It is pure — text and a clock in, a decision
 * out — so every branch is testable without a runner, a log file or a real
 * limit. The bash side calls it through scripts/loop_runner_delay.mjs and
 * treats any failure as "use the normal interval", because a guard that can
 * kill the runner is worse than no guard.
 *
 * THREE ANSWERS, NEVER TWO (the house rule):
 *
 *   null                     no limit message in the text. Normal pacing.
 *   { seconds, reason }      a limit with a readable reset: sleep until then.
 *   { seconds: DEFAULT_BACKOFF_SECONDS, reason }
 *                            a limit whose time could not be read. Backing off
 *                            a fixed half hour is honest — "we know we are
 *                            limited, we do not know until when" — where
 *                            pretending no limit exists would burn the next
 *                            three passes discovering it again.
 *
 * SINCE 2026-09-20 (task 86bc3t0n1, round 2) `limitDelay` IS NO LONGER THE
 * RUNNER'S QUESTION. It answers "does this text name a usage limit, and when
 * does it reset" — a text question, and the only one text can honestly answer.
 * The runner asks `passOutcome` instead, which decides from the pass's EXIT
 * CODE first and consults this function only afterwards. See its header for
 * the two live failures that forced the split.

 * WHAT DID THIS PASS ACTUALLY DO? (task 86bc3t0n1, round 2.)
 *
 * THE DEFECT, STATED ONCE: a pass's fate used to be decided by grepping its
 * prose, and that cuts both ways. Both have now been observed live.
 *
 *   - An authentication failure contains none of the expected words, so it fell
 *     through to the ordinary path and beat as a healthy working pass. 278
 *     consecutive failures wrote 278 healthy marks; the pipeline was dead for 90
 *     hours and every status screen said it was fine.
 *   - A pass that merely wrote ABOUT limits matched the pattern. On 2026-09-20
 *     the review pass quoted `LIMIT_LINE` in its own report, the regex matched
 *     that sentence in the log, and the review lane slept half an hour for
 *     nothing.
 *
 * AN EXIT CODE IS A FACT. LOG TEXT IS A GUESS ABOUT A FACT. So the exit code
 * decides first and the text is only ever consulted afterwards, for the one
 * thing it genuinely knows — WHICH kind of failure this was, and when a limit
 * says it resets. A pass that exited 0 produced its report and did its work; no
 * sentence inside that report can make it a stand-down.
 *
 * THREE ANSWERS, NEVER TWO, and they are not interchangeable:
 *
 *   ran         the pass worked (or honestly found nothing to do). Pace normally.
 *   stood-down  it could not work, and the thing stopping it clears ITSELF —
 *               a usage limit runs down. Sleep until it does.
 *   blocked     it could not work, and nothing will change that without a human
 *               at a keyboard — an expired login, or a failure naming no cause
 *               that clears itself. Do NOT sleep on it: sleeping half an hour in
 *               front of a locked door 48 times a day is what the 90 hours were.
 *
 * @param {object} opts
 * @param {string} opts.text      this pass's output (already scoped to the pass)
