/**
 * ROUND 3'S SEND-BACK: a second road to the silence round 2 closed.
 *
 * `npm run throughput` can report two different UNKNOWNs — "I could not read
 * the Loop Queue" and "a ticket in Live has no closure date, so the zero this
 * stall rests on cannot be trusted" — and each keeps its own six-hour
 * suppression window so neither can gag the other. That was round 2's fix, and
 * it works.
 *
 * It left this: `clearUnknownStamps()` sits at the BOTTOM of
 * `scripts/loop_throughput.mjs`, below the `if (v.state === 'UNKNOWN')` block
 * that exits. So a pass that read ClickUp perfectly and then landed on the
 * `undated-closure` verdict exited without clearing the `unreadable` window —
 * while its own bus post said, in as many words, that the reading had
 * SUCCEEDED. Nine o'clock outage posts and stamps; ten o'clock reads fine and
 * posts the undated alert; eleven o'clock outage is swallowed until three.
 * The sentence being silenced is the most serious one in the file: "nothing in
 * the system is watching whether the queue is getting shorter."
 *
 * WHY THESE TESTS SPAWN THE SCRIPT. The round-3 review named the reason the
 * existing tests missed it: they assert the clearing loop EXISTS in the source,
 * and this defect is entirely about WHERE it sits. A test made of the same
 * material as the bug cannot catch the bug. So these run the real script, with
 * only the ClickUp read and the bus post stubbed, and then look at which stamp
 * files are on disk afterwards. `HOME` is redirected at a temp folder, so no
 * real suppression stamp is read or written; `PATH` is emptied so the `gh`
 * read takes its documented "not installed" branch rather than the network.
 *
 * BREAK TEST, MEASURED — see each test.
