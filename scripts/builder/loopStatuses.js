/**
 * The Loop Queue's statuses, and the order loop-build drains them.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-31, task 86bbr1u9v). Until today a ticket sent back
 * by review returned to `Queued`, where it was INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM WORK
 * THAT WAS NEVER STARTED. Three things followed, all of them measured:
 *
 *   1. It was invisible. "52 queued, 1 in review" read as 52 fresh tickets;
 *      six of them were half-built with open pull requests. Finding that out
 *      took a morning of reading logs by hand.
 *   2. It lost its place in line. A sent-back ticket re-entered the priority
 *      contest from scratch, so normal-priority rework never won against fresh
 *      high-priority work. #419 (Aug 25), #446, #447 and #449 did not go stale
 *      by accident — THE CLAIM RULE DID IT TO THEM.
 *   3. The cap could not report honestly. `wip-check` said "1 in flight, cap
 *      5" while five real branches sat open, because `Queued` is deliberately
 *      not counted — and it must not be, or the cap blocks the only work that
 *      could clear it (the 2026-08-25 deadlock, task 86bbm4zwd).
 *
 * So a send-back now lands in its own status, `Rework`, and this module is the
 * ONE place that says so. The name is Dane's call, 2026-08-31: "Recycle" was
 * rejected because recycling loses the thing's form, and here the branch, the
 * PR, the commits and the review notes all survive intact; "Send-back" was
 * rejected because it names the transition, and every other status on this
 * list names a state.
 *
 * WHY ONE MODULE AND NOT A STRING IN EACH CALLER. The status is read by the
 * claim gate, the pacing curve, the WIP cap, the pause sweep, the pulse and
 * the weekly report. `wipCap.ticketIdFromPrBody` already carries a comment
 * about the cost of two functions disagreeing about the same string; six would
 * be worse. A status list that drifts fails the way this ticket's own bug
 * failed — silently, and in the direction of looking fine.

//                          pass-reconcile all act on this one number.
//   LOOP_STALE_AFTER_HOURS ~3 hours — pulse.js. A loop LOG silent this long
