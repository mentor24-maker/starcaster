/**
 * IS ANY PART OF THE GOVERNANCE MACHINERY AUTO-MERGEABLE?
 *
 * The sibling of `check:automerge-reach`, pointed the other way. That check
 * asks "has an auto-mergeable file reached the SERVER?", because Lane B's
 * safety argument is that no served route reaches `scripts/`. This one asks
 * "has an auto-mergeable file reached the machinery that GOVERNS merging?",
 * because Lane B's other safety argument is that a machine may never merge a
 * change to the machinery that governs it — the merge step, the referee that
 * decides what a review PASS is, and the gates. Ratified doctrine, criterion 4:
 *
 *   "A machine may never auto-merge a change to the machinery that governs
 *    machines ... CI workflows, git hooks, check_conventions, nodeRoles,
 *    .gitattributes, THE MERGE STEP ITSELF, or this document."
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS (2026-09-06, task 86bbuzyra, the fourth catch-up merge).
 * `GOVERNANCE_STEMS` in `autoMergeLane.js` is a list maintained BY HAND, and a
 * hand-maintained list cannot cover a file that did not exist when it was
 * written. Between 2026-09-04 and 2026-09-06, six modules were lifted out of
 * the merge step into their own files — `mergeCompletion`, `mergeWindowLease`,
 * `mergeWindowLeaseFile`, `shipAlreadyLive`, `pipelineSweep`,
 * `strandedLocalWork` — and every one of them landed inside Lane B's folder
 * and outside the stem list. Measured on this branch the moment the catch-up
 * merge finished:
 *
 *     laneEligibility(['scripts/builder/mergeWindowLease.js'])
 *       -> { lane: 'B', reason: "all 1 changed file(s) are the pipeline's own
 *            tooling, tests or documents" }
 *
 * Nobody was careless. Refactoring behind a boundary is the normal way the
 * boundary expires, and it had already happened twice in one day to the
 * ClickUp client (see the `clickupRetry` and `clickupLedger` entries in
 * `autoMergeLane.js`). Dane predicted exactly this when he chose the boundary:
 *
 *   "A folder boundary is not permanent ... Otherwise this decision silently
 *    expires."                                          — Dane, 2026-09-04
 *
 * So the list stays by hand — a machine cannot be trusted to decide what
 * governs machines — but forgetting to extend it is no longer silent.
 *
 * TWO QUESTIONS, BECAUSE THEY FAIL DIFFERENTLY.
 *
 *   1. Can this file EXECUTE a merge? Structural and exact: it invokes
 *      `gh pr merge` or the GitHub merge endpoint. This is the strongest
 *      claim in the file and needs no judgement from anybody.
 *   2. Does the merge step DEPEND on it? A module the merge step imports
 *      decides what the merge step does, whether or not it runs `gh` itself.
 *      That is the extraction case above, and it is the one that actually
 *      happened.
 *
 * Question 2 carries a NAMED allowlist rather than a blanket rule, because a
 * blanket rule over-blocks: `pullRequestTitle.js` names a pull request and
 * cannot merge one. Three entries today. An entry is an exception and should
 * stay rare; a fourth is worth an argument, not a shrug.

/**
 * WHAT COUNTS AS GOVERNANCE MACHINERY — and therefore whose imports get asked
 * the question below.
 *
 * THREE KINDS, because `GOVERNANCE_STEMS` protects three kinds and says so in
 * its own section headings: the merge step, "the referee: what counts as a
 * review PASS", and the gates. Until 2026-09-06 only the FIRST of the three
 * had a guard, which review round 2 on task 86bbuzyra found. So the exact rot
 * this file exists to stop — a hand-kept list that cannot name a file
 * extracted after it was written — was still wide open for the other two, and
 * this branch is what newly exposes them: before Lane B, `scripts/` was
 * refused by accident. Measured on this branch before the fix:
 *
 *     laneEligibility(['scripts/builder/reviewGateClickup.js'])
 *       -> { lane: 'B' }   // decides whether the referee sees a passing verdict
 *
 * TWO OF THE THREE ARE DERIVED, NOT LISTED. The referee is found by stem and
 * the gates by the `scripts/check_` prefix — the same rules `governanceReason`
 * already uses to block them, so the two lists cannot disagree. Naming four
 * files here by hand, which is what the send-back suggested, would have
 * reproduced the original defect one door over: a sixteenth `scripts/check_*`
 * gate would be blocked on arrival and its dependencies still never asked.
 *
 * Deriving is not theory here — it found a file the hand list missed.
 * `scripts/pin_asset_versions.cjs` is imported by `check_asset_versions.cjs`
 * for `defaultHtmlTargets` and `hashFile`: it is that gate's target list and
 * its hash function, i.e. the gate's entire subject.
 *
 * The MERGE STEP stays a literal list because it shares no stem or prefix to
 * derive from. `every named root exists` below is what keeps it honest, and
 * the extraction guard is what catches the pieces it loses.
 *
 * `scripts/clickup_direct.mjs` is deliberately NOT a root even though it
 * performs the merge, and that carve-out survives this widening on purpose.
 * It is the 4000-line relay and imports 28 modules, most of them ordinary
 * ClickUp commands — `loopNote`, `operatorCard`, `buildStart`. Rooting here
 * would demand blocking all of them and would narrow Lane B far past the
 * boundary Dane actually chose, which is his call and not this test's. The
 * merge-step modules it imports are roots in their own right below, which is
 * where the real question lives.
