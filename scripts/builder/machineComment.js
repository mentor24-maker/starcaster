/**
 * "Did a machine write this comment, or did Dane?"
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-09-01, task 86bbqx2xe). The loops post to ClickUp
 * under Dane's own API token, so every card a machine writes comes back from
 * the API stamped with HIS user id. Everything downstream asked authorship the
 * only way it could — `Number(c.user.id) === OPERATOR_ID` — and got "yes" for
 * comments no human had ever seen.
 *
 * The damage was the escalation lane. `ask` posts an operator card and moves a
 * ticket to `Needs your input` with Dane assigned; the next bus-relay pass, ten
 * minutes later, read that card as a fresh answer FROM him, relayed it to the
 * bus as "Dane replied", and handed the ticket back to `Queued`. The ticket
 * left `Assigned to me` — the one view he trusts — and the next loop-build pass
 * would claim it and try to build the very thing that had been escalated. The
 * card stayed on the ticket, so from the ticket it looked handled. Only the
 * status and the assignee were gone.
 *
 * It hid well because it is self-limiting: the hand-back is gated on FRESHLY
 * relayed comments, so re-setting the status by hand sticks and only the
 * original escalation is lost.
 *
 * `waiting` was fooled by the same mechanism, in the quieter direction — it
 * under-reports. A `Ready to launch` ticket always has a machine card as its
 * newest comment, so `waiting` answered "his own comment is the newest word on
 * it" and called it NOT_WAITING. An agent asking "does anything need Dane?"
 * before writing its run report was told no while five merges sat parked.
 * That blindness was already self-confirming once: the override note on
 * 86bbpz1ed cited `waiting` as evidence that the guard had been fooled — a
 * tool fooled by the same mechanism.
 *
 * THE FIX IS A MARKER, NOT A TOKEN. The real fix is a separate ClickUp
 * identity for the loops, and it is entangled with 86bbq8qa8; this is the
 * cheap one that works today and does not depend on the token at all.
 *
 * IT IS STAMPED AT ONE CHOKE POINT. `call()` in clickup_direct.mjs stamps
 * every POST to a comment endpoint, because there are fourteen separate
 * comment-posting sites in that file and a fifteenth added later would fail
 * SILENTLY IN THE DANGEROUS DIRECTION — an unmarked machine card reads as
 * Dane's word and releases his escalation. Stamping at the door means a new
 * caller inherits the guard instead of having to remember it.
 *
 * WHICH WAY IT FAILS. Detection is deliberately anchored to the LAST non-empty
 * line, which is where the stamp is written and nowhere else. So if Dane
 * pastes a machine card ABOVE words of his own, the marker lands mid-text and
 * his comment is still read as his.
 *
 * IT ONLY HOLDS FOR THAT ONE ORDERING, and the qualifier was missing here
 * until 2026-09-06 (task 86bbv8nvy round 2). Paste the card UNDERNEATH his
 * words and the stamp is the last line of HIS comment, so the whole thing
 * reads as machine-written — and quoting below your reply is at least as
 * natural as quoting above it.
 *
 * WHAT THAT COSTS DEPENDS ENTIRELY ON THE CALL SITE, which is why this note
 * cannot answer for all of them:
 *
 *   - HERE, at the escalation and the kill switch, mistaking his word for a
 *     machine's leaves the escalation unreleased. The ticket stays with him,
 *     he is not told it was handled, and the failure is LOUD. That is the
 *     correct direction, and the opposite of the bug this replaces.
 *
 *   - AT LANE A's objection filter it is the reverse: a discounted objection
 *     MERGES the pull request he said hold on, silently, an hour later. That
 *     site therefore cannot run on the stamp alone, and does not — see
 *     `quotesMachineText` in scripts/builder/autoMergeLane.js. Any future
 *     caller whose failure direction is an action rather than a stall owes
 *     itself the same second question.
 *
 * COMMENTS WRITTEN BEFORE THIS SHIPPED carry no marker and still read as his.
 * Nothing can be done about that from here; the legacy prefixes below catch
 * the machine comments that already announced themselves.

/**
 * Is this comment machine-written BY THE STAMP ALONE?

 *
 * WHY IT IS SEPARATE (2026-09-06, task 86bbv8nvy round 1). `isMachineComment`
 * answers two questions at once: the tail stamp `call()` writes, and a
 * head-anchored tag a machine announced itself with before the stamp existed.
 * The head half is deliberately wide — the bus kill-switch reader and the
 * reconciler both need it, and it was widened on purpose (task 86bbuv99r)
 * because the party line carries `[CC-starcaster loop-build]` and
 * `[reconciler]` all day.
 *
 * But a head-anchored tag is exactly what Dane types when he QUOTES a card and
 * replies under it, which is how he objects. Measured:
 *
 *     "[CC-starcaster loop-review] REVIEW: PASSED ...
 *      wait, do not merge this yet — I want to look"
 *
 * — his words, classified as a machine's. Only a body whose LAST line is the
 * stamp counts here, which is the same choice `isMachineComment` makes for the
 * stamp, kept and nothing else.
 *
 * THIS IS NOT A COMPLETE ANSWER TO QUOTING, and the first version of this note
 * claimed it was: "a pasted card puts the marker MID-text". That is true only
 * when he types AFTER the paste. Pasted UNDER his words, the card's stamp is
 * the last line of his comment and this reader says machine. A caller that
 * cannot afford that reading needs a second question — Lane A's objection
 * filter asks `quotesMachineText`; see the note at the head of this file for
 * why the answer differs by call site.
 *
 * IT COSTS NOTHING TO BE THIS STRICT. Sampled 2026-09-06 over 110 real
 * comments on 40 Loop Queue tickets: 100 classify as machine-written, and
 * every one of them via the tail stamp. Zero needed the head tag.
