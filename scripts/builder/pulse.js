/**
 * `npm run pulse` — the pipeline's vital signs. Phase 1 of the diagnostics
 * design (task 86bbm9h60): the three checks that would have caught this week.
 *
 * THE THESIS. Seven incidents in the week to 2026-08-25. NOT ONE WAS A CRASH.
 * Every one was a component that ran, exited 0, and accomplished nothing — a
 * build loop declining 13 passes in a row on a deadlocked cap, tickets sitting
 * 70 hours in `Building`, a PR and its ticket linked in only one direction.
 * A health check would have passed during all of them, because every process
 * involved was alive and every exit code was 0.
 *
 * So THESE DIAGNOSTICS MEASURE FLOW, NEVER STATUS. "Is it running" is the
 * question that failed; "is anything moving" is the question that works.
 *
 * This file is the pure half: parsing, thresholds and classification, with no
 * network, no filesystem and no clock of its own. Every reader lives in
 * `scripts/pulse.cjs`. That split is criterion 6 of the ticket and it is what
 * makes the thresholds testable — a number nobody can break-test is a number
 * that gets tuned by whoever is annoyed that day.
 *
 * THE FIVE RULES, which matter more than the checks themselves:
 *
 *   1. SILENCE IS NEVER ALL-CLEAR. Every check reports even when it is happy,
 *      so "all clear" and "the job died" can never look alike. That is the
 *      failure this whole module exists to prevent, so it is not optional and
 *      `formatReport` has no quiet mode.
 *   2. "CANNOT TELL" IS ITS OWN STATE, never folded into "fine" (DOCTRINE
 *      3.11). Every check returns a `cannotTell` array beside its findings,
 *      and a source that could not be read is named with its reason.
 *   3. EVERY COUNT CARRIES ITS BREAKDOWN. `7 open, cap 5` was true and hid a
 *      deadlock for four passes. A bare number is not a finding here.
 *   4. NAME THE BOTTLENECK IN A SENTENCE. A table of rates makes the reader do
 *      arithmetic they will skip, so `bottleneckSentence` does it for them.
 *   5. THE PULSE CANNOT FAIL SILENTLY EITHER. It ends with a stamped
 *      completion line, so a scheduled run that produces no report is itself
 *      the alert. (It writes no file: the ticket's non-goals forbid the pulse
 *      writing anything, so the completion line is the heartbeat, and a
 *      persisted one belongs to phase 2.)

/**
 * How a pass is classified, and WHY these markers and not others.
 *
 * The log body is the agent's own prose report, not tool output — there is no
 * structured claim record to read. So classification keys off the DETERMINISTIC
 * STRINGS the loop's own commands print, which a pass quotes verbatim when it
 * declines: `wipCap.js`'s "WIP cap reached — N PR(s) open, cap M",
 * `nodeRoles.js`'s "so it did nothing.", and the harness's own quota notice.
 *
 * Measured against 580 real passes (2026-08-22 → 08-26): 90% classify, and the
 * remaining 10% land in `unknown`, which is reported as CANNOT TELL rather than
 * as a decline. THAT ASYMMETRY IS DELIBERATE. Guessing "declined" from an
 * unreadable pass invents an outage; guessing "claimed" hides one. Neither is
 * acceptable, so an unreadable pass says so.
 *
 * Order matters: a decline marker wins over the claim marker, because a capped
 * pass often names the PRs it counted and would otherwise read as a claim. The
 * markers are the quoted messages precisely so that stays true — an early
 * draft matched `wip-check` and `exit 3` anywhere in the body and mislabelled a
 * rework pass whose `build-start` had exited 3 for an entirely different reason.

 * ticket, or close the PR as superseded — and only a person knows which.
 *
 * @param records  one per ticket:
 *   { taskId, name, status,
 *     ticketPrNumbers,   every "PR opened:" number in the ticket's comments
 *     buildStartSees,    what findPullRequest() returns — the number
 *                        build-start would act on, or null
 *     buildStartPrState, that PR's state, or null for "could not read it"
