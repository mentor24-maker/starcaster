 * Ready-to-launch tickets sat for hours after Dane commented "merge" on

 * party line, and the merge happened whenever a human session next looked.
 * His comment on a reviewed ticket IS the explicit merge authorization the
 * doctrine requires (LOOP_ENGINEERING, "Safety"); the only thing missing
 * was hands. This module is the decision half of those hands — pure
 * functions over comment lists and a `gh pr view` payload, so every refusal
 * path is testable without touching GitHub or ClickUp.
 *
 * The plumbing that carries the decisions out lives in
 * scripts/clickup_direct.mjs (`bus-relay`), the same pass that already
 * relays his comments. Nothing here performs a merge, and nothing here
 * loosens the standing rules: only the operator's own user id authorizes,
 * only a ticket already promoted to Ready to launch by loop-review is
 * eligible, and a script never resolves a merge conflict.

 * isReviewVerdict but not isReviewPassed — exactly the distinction the
 * precondition needs. Neither pattern reads the DESTINATION, which is what
 * lets the status be renamed without invalidating the history.
 *
 * IT MUST ALSO CARRY ONE OF THE VERDICT WORDS (2026-09-01, task 86bbrem48).
 * This used to be `/^\s*REVIEW\b.*$/im` — any line beginning with the word
 * "Review", which is a shape loop-review itself emits in ordinary prose. The
 * operator card it posts alongside a PASS contains the line
 *
 *   Review re-ran everything independently on the merged code: typecheck ...
 *
 * and that card is NEWER than the verdict. `all` is correctly newest-first,
 * so `.find` returned the CARD, `isReviewPassed` was false, and four approved
 * tickets were refused overnight with "the most recent review verdict is not
 * a PASS" — a false statement, while the queue sat still behind a full WIP
 * cap. The review pass was poisoning its own verdict.
 *
 * The refusal was also permanent and self-concealing: it tells the operator
 * "your approval is still standing ... the moment the reason above is dealt
 * with it goes through on its own", and the reason can never be dealt with,
 * because the card is newer than the verdict and always will be.
 *
 * `verdictComment` (scripts/builder/loopTrail.js) is the ONE producer, and it
 * emits exactly two headings. Keying on those words rather than on the bare
 * prefix is what separates a verdict from prose — and it is STRICTER than
 * what it replaced, never more willing to merge, which is the only safe
 * direction for the gate in front of production.
 *
 * THE TWO CHANGES MEET HERE ON PURPOSE (2026-09-01, ticket 86bbrf2y3). The
 * Rework rename and the prose fix landed within an hour of each other and
 * conflicted on this comment alone. They are compatible in substance: the

/**
 * WAITING FOR CI INSIDE ONE PASS (2026-08-24, task 86bbk2fb5).
 *
 * Merging one PR is about three minutes of real work — catch the branch up,
 * run CI (`verify` median 85 seconds), merge. We were achieving 1.25 merges an
 * hour, with the pipeline idle roughly 95% of the time.
 *
 * The cost was the SHAPE, not the work. It took two passes to merge one PR:
 * pass N caught the branch up and returned `waiting`; CI finished 85 seconds
 * later; pass N+1 merged it an hour after that. A three-minute job took two
 * hours.
 *
 * It gets worse as the queue grows, not better. Branch protection is
 * `strict: true`, so a branch must be current with main to merge — meaning
 * EVERY merge invalidates every other open branch. At 24 open PRs each merge
 * leaves 23 needing catch-up, and a catch-up done an hour ago is stale before
 * the next pass reaches it. The two-pass shape can lose a race with its own
 * previous pass.
 *
 * So after a catch-up push, the pass waits for the check run rather than
 * going away for an hour. Three rules keep that bounded:
 *
 *   - A BUDGET, not patience. ~2x the observed median. When it runs out the
 *     answer is `wait` — exactly what the pass returned before — never a
 *     merge and never a failure. A slow CI run is not a broken one.
 *   - A CAP per pass, so one stuck PR cannot starve the rest. Beyond the cap
 *     everything falls through to `wait` and the next pass takes it.
 *   - The SAME gate. Nothing here decides whether a PR may merge; it only
 *     decides whether to ask again. Red is refused by the existing path, with
 *     the existing wording.
 */

/**
 * How long a pass will hold itself open waiting on CI.
 *
 * MEASURED AGAINST `verify`, AND THE MEASUREMENT MOVED (2026-09-03, task

 * median is no longer true: four consecutive runs on PR #571 that afternoon
 * took 127s, 317s, 346s and 342s. 180s is now SHORTER than the thing it is
 * waiting for, which is not a slow wait — it is a wait that can never
 * succeed.
 *
 * It is deliberately NOT raised to cover the new figure, and that is the
 * point of this ticket. The bound is not free: MAX_IN_PASS_WAITS x this must
 * stay under the relay's own 600s interval (see below), so covering a 350s CI
 * run would mean a cap of one, and one stuck PR would spend the whole pass.
 * A budget cannot be both big enough for CI and small enough for the
 * schedule.
 *
 * So the merge path no longer tries to win that race. It hands the PR to
 * GitHub's own auto-merge (see autoMergeDecision) and returns immediately;
 * GitHub merges it whenever the checks go green, however long they take, and
 * keeps the branch current itself. This budget survives only for the one
 * caller that genuinely must wait in-pass — the stale review-gate re-run,
 * which has to see a NEW answer appear before it can act on anything.

 * GITHUB'S AUTO-MERGE, AND WHY THE RELAY STOPPED WAITING (2026-09-03, task
 * 86bbup3u1).
 *
 * `main` is protected with `strict: true`, so a branch must contain every
 * commit on main to merge, and every merge invalidates every other open
 * branch. The relay's answer was to catch the branch up itself and then wait
 * out CI in-pass. That works when the queue is quiet and CANNOT work when it
 * is busy, which is exactly when the merge lane matters: catch up, restart
 * CI, run out of budget, defer — and by the next pass main has moved again.
 * On 2026-09-03 the operator said "merge" at 15:43 and the PR was still open
 * an hour later, having gone round that loop four times. Nothing refused and
 * nothing errored; every pass was a healthy pass.
 *
 * The fix is to stop racing. GitHub will hold a merge itself: armed on a PR,
 * auto-merge lands it the moment the required checks pass, and with
 * `allow_update_branch` on it does the catch-up too. The relay arms it and
 * goes home.
 *
 * WHAT ARMING IS NOT. It is not a second merge gate. Arming happens ONLY on
 * the two non-terminal answers — `wait` (checks still running) and
 * `update-branch` (behind main) — which the existing gate reaches only after
 * every other precondition already holds: the PR is open, not a draft, not
 * conflicting, no check is red, and the operator's word is on the ticket.
 * `refuse` and `conflict` are untouched and never arm. GitHub then applies
 * the branch protection rules on its own account, so an armed PR whose checks
 * later go red does not merge.
