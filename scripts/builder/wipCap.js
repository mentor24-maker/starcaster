/**
 * Should loop-build claim another ticket, or is the merge side already full?
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-24). Branch protection is `strict: true` — a branch
 * must be current with `main` before it can merge. That rule is right: it
 * guarantees the tests that passed ran against exactly what becomes live, and
 * `main` auto-deploys to production.
 *
 * ITS COST IS QUADRATIC IN THE NUMBER OF OPEN PRs. Every merge invalidates
 * every other open branch, so with N open each merge dates N-1 branches, each
 * needing its own catch-up and its own CI run. On 2026-08-23 with 24 open PRs
 * a single merge dated 23 branches, and the relay spent most of its work
 * re-catching-up branches that were stale again before they could be used.
 *
 * Double the open PRs and you quadruple the churn. That is why the intuitive
 * fix — more build loops, more machines — makes throughput WORSE.
 *
 * Throughput is min(build rate, review rate, merge rate). Merge is the
 * slowest, so work queued beyond the merge rate does not ship sooner; it rots,
 * and rotting costs real work. Capping work in progress does not slow
 * delivery. It removes the churn that was eating the merge side's capacity.
 *
 * It also makes the queue honest: "26 queued, 5 in flight" is true. "26 queued
 * and 24 half-built" is not.
 */

/**
 * Where to start. Five is not measured — it is a starting point chosen to sit
 * comfortably above the observed merge rate (about 1.25/hour before the
 * in-pass merge fix, task 86bbk2fb5) while leaving room for review turnaround.
 * Raise it when the merge side demonstrably keeps up; lower it if the catch-up

 * cap of five covered both machine work and operator-held work, so a ticket
 * waiting on Dane's merge consumed a build slot. See IN_PROGRESS_STATUSES in
 * loopStatuses.js for the full argument; the short version is that "is the
 * merge pipeline full?" and "should loop-build stop producing?" are different
 * questions, and one number could only answer them by getting one wrong.
 *
 * WHY IT IS A CEILING AND NOT "UNCOUNTED". Simply not counting operator-held
 * work would leave the number of open pull requests unbounded, and that is the
 * exact cost the cap was built to control: branch protection is `strict:true`,
 * so every merge dates every other open branch (see this file's header). Ten
 * waiting PRs mean ten catch-up merges when they drain. That cost is real and
 * does not go away because it is inconvenient — so operator-held work is still
 * bounded, just at its own larger number, and the loop declines with a
 * DIFFERENT message saying which of the two limits it hit.
 *
 * TEN, and where it comes from: Dane's stated target on 2026-09-04 — wake in
 * the night and clear ten. It is his number, not a measurement, and it is the
 * right kind of number to put here because the thing being bounded is his
 * queue. Raise it once a merge queue absorbs the catch-up churn (task
 * 86bbv1qp9); until then ten is roughly ten catch-up merges to drain, which is

 * deadlocked the build loop for four consecutive hourly passes: seven PRs open
 * against a cap of five, of which FIVE should never have counted — three whose
 * tickets had been sent back to `Queued` for rework (so the cap was blocking
 * the only thing that could close them) and two zombies whose tickets were
 * already `Live`, shipped by a different PR.
 *
 * The cap asks "how many PRs are open?" when it means "how much work is in
 * flight". Those are the same number only when every open PR has a ticket
 * somebody is moving, and they diverge in two entirely ordinary situations —
 * a send-back and an abandoned duplicate. Both were present.
 *
 * `Rework` and `Queued` are deliberately NOT here: a ticket in either with an
 * open PR is work waiting to be CLAIMED, and counting it is what caused the
 * deadlock. `Live` is not here either — the work shipped; the PR is a
 * leftover.
 *
 * `Rework` did not exist until 2026-08-31 (task 86bbr1u9v). Before it a
 * sent-back ticket sat in `Queued`, so this file had to INFER "that one is
 * rework" from the ticket being queued — which is precisely why it could not
 * tell a send-back from work nobody had started. It reads the real status now.
 * Dane took the recommendation that rework stays uncounted, for the reason
 * above: the cap answers "how many NEW things may I start", and rework is not
 * new. That is not a licence to omit it silently, which is the whole point of
 * the new status — `wipDecision` names the rework count in BOTH its messages.
 *
 * `Needs your input` IS here (review round 1). It is operator-held, exactly
 * like `Ready to launch` which was never in doubt: a ticket parked on Dane
 * with an open PR is real work occupying the merge pipeline, and its branch
 * still needs catching up every time something lands. Counting it is also the
 * honest answer — if his inbox is full, the pipeline genuinely is full, and a
 * cap that hid that would be lying in the more dangerous direction.

/**
 * The ONE reading of "is the merge side full?", shared by every caller.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-31, task 86bbq8br2). `wip-check` and
 * `next-interval` both answered that question, from the same module, and
 * reached OPPOSITE answers for eight months' worth of a morning: the claim
 * gate said "4 in flight, cap 5 — room to claim another" while the sleep timer
 * wrote "the work-in-progress cap is full" into the log and slept the maximum
 * hour, with 38 tickets claimable.
 *
 * The cause was not a wrong rule. It was two call sites: `next-interval` asked
 * GitHub for `number,state` and called `wipDecision` with no
 * `ticketStatusById`, so it took the documented conservative fallback — count
 * EVERY open PR — while `wip-check` asked for `body` too, read the queue, and
 * correctly excluded the four PRs whose tickets were `Queued` for rework. Both
 * behaved exactly as written. They were simply not the same reading.
 *
 * That is the failure mode `ticketIdFromPrBody` already carries a comment
 * about — two functions disagreeing about the same string — so the fix is
 * structural rather than a matching edit in two places: the reading happens
 * HERE, once, and a caller supplies only the two I/O calls.
 *
 * What is deliberately NOT shared is the direction each caller fails in, which
 * is a real difference and not duplication:
 *
 *   - `wip-check` fails OPEN. Refusing on a transient `gh` hiccup would stop
 *     all work; the cost of guessing wrong is some catch-up churn.
 *   - `next-interval` fails toward CAPPED. Its pass has already run and the
 *     only question is how long to sleep, so the safe direction is the long
 *     one.
 *
 * So this returns `determined:false` and says why, rather than choosing.
 *
 * @param {object} opts
 * @param {() => Promise<object[]|null>} opts.listOpenPrs  open PRs, each with
 *   `number`, `state` AND `body` — `classifyPrs` matches a PR to its ticket
 *   through the body, so a caller that omits it gets the statuses-unavailable
 *   fallback no matter how well the queue read went.
 * @param {() => Promise<object|null>} opts.readTicketStatuses  id -> status
 *   string for the Loop Queue, closed tickets INCLUDED (a zombie PR's ticket
 *   is `Live`, and without it the PR reports as "no ticket found").
 * @param {number} [opts.cap]
 * @returns {Promise<{determined:boolean, why:string|null, decision:object|null,
 *   statusesAvailable:boolean, queueFailure:string|null}>}
