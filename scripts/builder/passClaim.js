/**
 * THE CLAIM MARKER — how a loop-build pass proves it finished what it started.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-09-02, task 86bbtmbpc). A loop pass claims a ticket by
 * moving it to "Building", and the loops claim only from "Rework" and
 * "Queued". So a pass that ends without handing its ticket on leaves it
 * unreachable — not slow, not queued, but invisible to every actor in the
 * system, forever, until a person moves it by hand.
 *
 * It happened twice on the night of 2026-09-01, in two shapes that need
 * different answers:
 *
 *   86bbjt1b4  the pass RAN TO COMPLETION. It finished PR #449, wrote
 *              "I have a waiter armed that will bring me back the moment all
 *              four checks settle", and exited 0 at 00:29 without moving the
 *              ticket. There is no coming back: a pass is a one-shot
 *              `claude -p` session that ends when it stops producing output.
 *
 *   86bbr2jpq  the pass was KILLED. Claimed at 2:06am, dead at 2:08 on
 *              "You've hit your session limit · resets 2:50am".
 *
 * The second is why none of this lives inside the pass. Nothing in a killed
 * session runs again — no `Stop` hook, no "before you finish" instruction, no
 * amount of skill prose. The repair has to be done by something that runs
 * AFTERWARDS, and the cheapest thing guaranteed to run afterwards is the next
 * pass: the runner is a `while true` loop, and a fresh session is precisely
 * what survives the previous one being killed.
 *
 * So: claiming writes a marker, handing off clears it, and every pass begins
 * by reconciling whatever the last one left behind.
 *
 * WHY THE MARKER IS OPT-IN. A hand-driven fast-track session claims tickets
 * with the same command. If every claim wrote a marker, a later loop pass
 * would find a ticket a person is actively building and hand it back out from
 * under them. Only the loop skill passes `--pass`, and that is the whole of
 * the safety argument — there is no timing heuristic here to get wrong.

 *
 * This command was written as the FIRST thing a new `loop-build` pass runs,
 * and in that seat one inference is free: the runner is a serial `while true`
 * loop, so a new pass starting means the previous pass ENDED. A ticket still
 * in "Building" therefore has nothing working on it, and the status alone is
 * proof enough.
 *
 * Then `npm run repair` started calling the same command on a timer — the
 * relay's ten-minute idle wake, throttled to one reading per half hour. The
 * inference does not travel: a schedule firing says nothing whatever about
 * whether a pass is running. So a build that outlived the throttle had its
 * LIVE claim revoked on a timer, twice in one morning on task 86bbqb0ac,
 * while the pass was still building. Between the revocation and the pass's own
 * hand-off the ticket sits in "Queued" — claimable — with a live pass on it,
 * which is the 2026-08-20 double-build arriving through the mechanism meant to
 * prevent stranding.

 * `clickup_direct.mjs claim` process, which exits seconds after writing the
 * file, not of the pass. Measured on a live claim on 2026-09-04: the marker
 * for a ticket being actively built named pid 21193, already gone. A liveness
 * probe on it would call EVERY claim dead — the present bug, re-derived — and
 * pid reuse would occasionally do the reverse and strand a ticket forever.
 *
 * So: age, and BORROWED rather than re-declared. `pipelinePause` already
 * answers "how long may a pass hold a ticket before it is stranded rather than
 * busy", argued out to ninety minutes ("longer than any pass observed to date
 * and far shorter than forever"). A second number here would be a second

 *   undated      SCHEDULED caller only: the ticket is in "Building" and the
