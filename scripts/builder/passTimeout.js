/**
 * WHAT A PASS WAS DOING WHEN THE TIME LIMIT STOPPED IT (task 86bccr85c).
 *
 * On 2026-10-04 the build lane on the Mini did no useful work from 1:54am to
 * past 1:42pm: five passes on "Galaxy module 5/6", each stopped at the
 * two-hour limit by `run_with_time_limit.sh` (exit 124). The cause was one
 * render contract the pass kept fixing and re-running, an ~8-minute
 * `npm run check:render` each time. But `claude -p` prints its report only at
 * the end, so a stopped pass left NOTHING between START and END in the log and
 * nothing on the ticket — a stuck test and a dead machine were the same
 * picture, and finding the cause took a session copying the work to another
 * machine and re-running the check by hand.
 *
 * Two answers live here, both pure:
 *
 *   1. Name what was running. `run_with_time_limit.sh` writes the process tree
 *      under the pass at the moment of the stop (one tab-separated line per
 *      process: depth, pid, elapsed, command); `describeStuck` reads it and
 *      names the gate — `npm run check:render, running 7m 12s` — or says that
 *      nothing was running at all, which is the 2026-09-12 idle-pass shape.
 *
 *   2. Stop feeding the same ticket to the time limit. The next pass's
 *      `pass-reconcile` hands a stopped pass's ticket straight back to the
 *      claim line, where it is claimed first again — five times that day. So
 *      each stop leaves a note on the ticket, and the SECOND stop since the
 *      ticket last reached a pull request escalates to Dane with what is known
 *      instead of costing another two hours.
