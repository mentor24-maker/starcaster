/**
 * Claude Code Stop hook -- the operator hand-off tripwire.
 * Enforces CLAUDE.md "CC runs the operational commands" / DOCTRINE.md §6.9.
 *
 * If the reply about to be delivered hands Dane a fenced command that CC could
 * have run itself, and does not name one of the four exceptions, refuse the
 * stop and say so. Exit 2 blocks the stop and shows stderr to the agent.
 *
 * WHY A STOP HOOK AND NOT A PRE-COMMIT CHECK
 * The failure is "the turn ended with a command block in it". Pre-commit
 * cannot see the message and neither can CI; the reply is the only place that
 * fact exists. Same reasoning as require_sql_handoff.cjs, and the same shape.
 *
 * INTERACTIVE SESSIONS ONLY
 * A hand-off is only a hand-off if somebody is being handed something. The
 * loops run headless (`entrypoint: "sdk-cli"`) and report to a ticket, so
 * there is no operator at the other end and nothing to protect. Only `cli`
 * -- a terminal Dane is sitting in front of -- can trip this.
 *
 * IT FAILS OPEN, ON PURPOSE
 * If the transcript cannot be read, or the entrypoint cannot be determined,
 * this steps aside. That is the opposite of the pipeline switch's fail-safe
 * and the asymmetry is genuinely reversed here: a wrong refusal wedges a turn
 * and can strand an unattended pass in `Building`, while a miss just leaves
 * the written rule doing the work it was already doing. Three refusals per
 * session, then it stands down for the same reason.
 *
 * Escape hatch: SKIP_OPERATOR_HANDOFF=1 (say so and why, per CLAUDE.md).

 * THE COUNTER MUST NOT SIT BEHIND `if (stateDir(...))`.
 * It used to, and that made the brake vanish in precisely the conditions where
 * it is needed most. `stateDir()` shells out to git, so it comes back empty
 * when the cwd is outside any repo, or when `git` is not on PATH -- a
 * documented condition in agent shells on this machine, where a bare PATH
 * without /opt/homebrew/bin is the normal starting state. With no counter the
 * hook refuses EVERY turn, forever, which is the wedged conversation this
 * file's header calls worse than the miss it prevents. So the state falls back
 * to the temp directory: a worse place to keep it, and infinitely better than
 * nowhere.
 *
 * If nothing at all is writable there is no brake to be had, and the honest
 * response is to let the turn end rather than refuse without a limit.
