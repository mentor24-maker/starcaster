/**
 * The IO half of loopRunnerGuard: read the tail of a pass log, print ONE line —
 *
 *   <kind> <seconds>
 *
 * `kind` is `ran`, `stood-down` or `blocked`; `seconds` is how long the runner
 * should sleep because of a usage limit, or 0 for "pace normally". The reason
 * goes to stderr, which the runner appends to the same log, so neither the
 * sleep nor the kind is ever a mystery.
 *
 *   node scripts/loop_runner_delay.mjs <log-file> [--exit <code>]
 *
 * TWO FIELDS, NOT ONE, SINCE 2026-09-20 (task 86bc3t0n1, round 2). This used to
 * print only the seconds, so the runner had nothing to record about a pass
 * except "it came back" — and from 2026-09-18 both lanes came back 278 times
 * having failed to authenticate, beat as healthy every time, and the pipeline
 * read as fine for 90 hours. The kind is the half that was missing.
 *
 * `--exit` IS THE FACT AND IT COMES FIRST. A pass's exit code decides what it
 * was; the log text is consulted only afterwards, for which kind of failure and
 * when a limit resets. When `--exit` is not given — running this by hand
 * against a log, which is how the ticket's own test steps read — the code is
 * read back off the runner's own END banner in that log. No banner and no flag
 * means the code is UNKNOWN, which is a third answer and is never rounded down
 * to zero.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE MAY FAIL THE RUNNER. Every problem — missing file, unreadable
 * tail, a bug in this script — prints a line and exits 0. A guard that can kill
 * the loop it guards is the one outcome worse than the blind retries it was
 * written to stop (task 86bbtuje2). On an internal failure it answers
 * `blocked 0`: the runner keeps its normal pacing, and a pass this script could
 * not read about is not recorded as a healthy one.
 *
 * Only THIS pass's output is scanned (`scopeToLastPass`): the log tail still
 * carries the previous pass's lines, and a 2:38am "resets 2:50am" sitting
 * above a 3:00am pass that succeeded would otherwise read as a limit whose
 * reset is 23 hours away — a healthy pass answered with a needless backoff.
