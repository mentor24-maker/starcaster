/**
 * WHERE AN ALARM GOES WHEN THE PARTY LINE WILL NOT TAKE IT.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (task 86bbwab1n, measured 2026-09-07/08)
 * The bus is the ONLY surface on which this pipeline raises an alarm. Every
 * one of these posts there and nowhere else:
 *
 *   heartbeat --check / --stale-check   a scheduled job stopped firing
 *   throughput --check                  the queue is STALLED, or UNKNOWN
 *   report_job_failure.mjs              a scheduled job failed
 *   reconcile --check                   ClickUp and the branches disagree
 *   stale_answer / checkout_currency    an answer or a checkout went stale
 *
 * On 2026-09-07 ClickUp's chat write endpoint began returning
 * `400 Invalid Request` for every message on the party line, including the
 * single word `test`. Reads on the same channel with the same token return
 * 200, and task-comment writes with the same token succeed — so it is not the
 * token, not the quota and not the channel id. The last message that landed
 * was 2026-09-07T21:39:49Z; every alarm raised after it was discarded with no
 * trace anywhere but the calling job's own console.
 *
 * This is the SECOND time. `scripts/clickup_direct.mjs` already carries a
 * comment naming "the 2026-08-23 chat outage", and records the one thing that
 * kept working through it: task comments. The relay grew a durable fallback
 * out of that day (`deliverToBus`), but it covers RELAYED messages only —
 * they have a ticket to fall back to, because the message is about one. The
 * alarms above have no ticket, so they got no fallback, so they are lost.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE DECIDES
 * An alarm with no ticket of its own still has somewhere to go: a standing
 * ticket whose whole job is to hold alarms the bus refused. Its identity is
 * its NAME, not an id in a config file — the same choice `nodeHeartbeat`'s
 * roll call and `pulseDigest`'s report make, for the same reason: a recorded
 * id rots the moment somebody deletes the ticket, and an id nobody can resolve
 * fails in exactly the way this whole ticket is about.
 *
 * The rendering lives here rather than in the command so it can be tested
 * without a network, and so the words a dropped alarm arrives wearing are one
 * reviewable thing rather than a template buried in a 5,000-line CLI.

/**
 * THE TEAM CHAT (task 86bc0mmyu, Dane's answer "(B) Stay on the free plan",

 *
 * ClickUp's chat channel is not on the Free Forever plan — the ClickUp app
 * says so in words ("Chat Messages isn't available on your current plan"),
 * the API reduces it to `400 Invalid Request`. Dane chose not to upgrade, so
 * this ticket stops being the place refused alarms are kept and becomes the
 * team chat on purpose: a plain name, and posts that do not arrive dressed as
 * errors. The chat channel is still tried first, so an upgrade later would put
 * messages back in the channel with no code change.
 *
 * The ticket's identity is still its NAME. `LEGACY_TASK_NAMES` are the names
 * it has had before: a ticket under one of them is the SAME ticket, renamed on
 * first contact (`saveUndeliveredAlarm`), because a machine still running the
 * old code looks it up by the old name and would otherwise create a second one.

/**
 * WHY A LOOP NOTE REFUSED, IN THE TERMS THAT CHANGE WHAT A PASS SHOULD DO.
 *
 * Two causes print the same failure today and they are opposites:
 *
 *   "not found"      the field has never been created. The pass carries on;
 *                    only the note is missing, and nothing was ever depending
 *                    on it. This is what the skills tell a pass to expect.
 *   "plan exhausted" the field EXISTS and refuses writes, because the
 *                    workspace is out of custom-field usages. The Loop note is
 *                    the only surface on which a pass in flight is visible to
 *                    another pass, so a refusal here means THIS PASS'S CLAIM
 *                    IS INVISIBLE and another pass may take the ticket out
 *                    from under it. That is the 2026-08-22 double-review
 *                    failure (PR #362) with the guard switched off.
 *
 * The skills say a stamp failure is not a failure of the build. That was right
 * when the only cause was "not set up yet". Told apart, the second cause can
 * say the thing that is actually true.
