 * Throughput — making "alive but useless" detectable.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-31, ticket 86bbqrw3p)
 * `npm run heartbeat` answers "did this job stop firing?". On 2026-08-31 the
 * build loop fired every hour, exited 0 every time, and did not move the
 * queue: 52 tickets queued, 1 in review, six rework PRs open with the oldest
 * sitting since Aug 25. Every gate was green and every green was honest.
 *
 * A heartbeat structurally cannot detect that. It measures LIVENESS, and the
 * loop was alive. Nothing in the system asked "is the queue getting shorter?"
 *
 * This is the same shape as the silence problem heartbeat was built for, one
 * level up — and worse in one specific way. A job that never fires writes
 * nothing at all, and nothing at least LOOKS like nothing. A loop that runs
 * and achieves nothing writes a full, cheerful log, which reads as health and
 * so stops anybody looking.
 *
 * FOUR STATES, NEVER TWO (docs/DOCTRINE.md 3.11)
 *   MOVING   tickets closed inside the window. The pipeline is delivering.
 *   IDLE     nothing closed, and there was nothing to close. Healthy, and it
 *            says WHY it is healthy rather than presenting a bare zero.
 *   STALLED  nothing closed while open work sat there. This is the finding.
 *   UNKNOWN  a reading needed for the verdict could not be taken. NEVER
 *            rendered as healthy — a monitor that fails quietly is worse than
 *            no monitor, because it converts "nobody is watching" into
 *            "something is watching" and then stops anybody looking.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE TOUCHES THE NETWORK OR THE CLOCK. Every decision is a pure
 * function over data the caller fetched, so `node --test` drives every branch
 * with no token, no ClickUp, no GitHub and no clock of its own. The IO lives
 * in scripts/loop_throughput.mjs.

 * STRANDED IN-FLIGHT WORK, which `pipeline -- status` already detects through

 * is sent, and it is named after the evidence rather than after the
 * conclusion, which is the fix of 2026-09-01 (task 86bbr2jpq, finding 3).
 *
 * IT USED TO BE CALLED `loopsFiring`, AND IT SAID "the loops ARE firing".
 * The only evidence behind it is `date_updated` on a Loop Queue ticket, and
 * ClickUp bumps that on ANY edit — a comment from Dane, a relay note, a
 * priority change. So the sentence asserted something the data cannot support,
 * and it asserted it in the one direction that costs a reader the most: the
 * loop lanes run inside long-lived agent sessions, so "no session is open" is
 * arguably the MOST likely cause of a stall, and that is exactly the case the
 * old wording sent them away from, hunting a pipeline bug.
 *
 * Renaming it made `false` answerable for the first time, which is a gain
 * rather than a cost. The old question ("did a loop pass run?") could not be
 * answered `false`, because a pass that finds the WIP cap full writes nothing
 * and is indistinguishable from a pass that never happened. The new question
 * ("was anything in the Loop Queue edited?") is a plain fact about the list,
 * and `false` — nothing edited at all for 24 hours — is a genuinely useful
 * finding rather than a guess.
 *
 * `undatedRecent` is the other half of the same discipline: a count of
 * finished tickets that carry no closure date and were edited inside the
 * window, so they COULD have closed in it and the zero cannot be trusted.
 * See `recentUndatedClosures`. It turns a stall into an UNKNOWN, never into a
 * pass — a reading nobody can justify is not a clean bill of health.
