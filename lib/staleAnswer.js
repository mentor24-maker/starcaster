/**
 * staleAnswer — Dane replied, and NOTHING MOVED.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-09-06, task 86bbvr4w3)
 *
 * He answered `C` on 86bbv8nvy at 09:40. The 09:46 relay pass delivered that
 * answer to the party line, ran out of ClickUp request budget before it could
 * return the ticket to `Queued`, said so correctly — and then posted that
 * report into a bus write the same rate limit skipped. The ticket sat in
 * `Needs your input` for three and a half hours until he found it himself.
 *
 * The retry that stops it being permanent lives in
 * `scripts/builder/busRelayPlan.js`. This is the other half: the alarm, for
 * every reason the hand-back might still not happen — a dead relay, an
 * exhausted budget three passes running, a bug nobody has found yet.
 *
 * WHY NONE OF THE FOUR EXISTING WATCHDOGS COULD SEE IT, which is the whole
 * argument for a fifth:
 *
 *   - the ROLL CALL reads a day-resolution row, and a perfectly healthy relay
 *     legitimately reads as ~21h stale between pushes. It cannot resolve hours,
 *     let alone minutes.
 *   - the STALE-CHECK measures the relay's own beats. The relay was healthy —
 *     it had beaten nine minutes earlier. The job was alive; one ticket fell
 *     out of it.
 *   - THROUGHPUT asks whether the queue is getting shorter, over days.
 *   - STALE-READY watches `Ready to launch`. This is `Needs your input`, the
 *     one stage where the thing being waited on is a MACHINE ACTION on words
 *     he has already written.
 *
 * WHOSE HANDS, AND THE ANSWER IS ALMOST ALWAYS "NOT YOURS". A ticket in this
 * stage carrying an answer newer than the question is by definition not
 * waiting on him — he has spoken. Saying otherwise is the failure
 * `docs/DOCTRINE.md` 2.5 was ratified against, and the same failure
 * `lib/staleReady.js` was written to stop the pulse committing.
 *
 * PURE, AND TESTED AS SUCH. No network, no clock, no filesystem — the IO lives
 * in `scripts/stale_answer.mjs`, the same split `lib/staleReady.js` uses.

 * do the work, and two more before a miss is real rather than a pass that was
 * simply mid-flight when the reading was taken. Retuning the relay's cadence
 * moves this with it instead of leaving a stale number behind, which is the

 * `out.res.ok` — which is `clickup_direct.mjs`'s envelope, a different door.
 * `call()` here returns `{ ok, status, json, text, resetSeconds }` and has no
 * `res` at all, so the check was `undefined` on every reading: `wasRelayed`
 * could only ever answer "could not tell", `delivered` could never be false,
 * and the `answer-undelivered` finding — the one that names the party line
 * rather than the hand-back — was unreachable in production. Every finding
 * printed "the answer was delivered ... the hand-back is failing", which is
 * the exact mis-diagnosis this module's own opening docstring says it exists
 * to prevent, on the one surface Dane reads. It also spent one ClickUp request
 * per stale ticket for a value that was always discarded.
 *
 * Pure, so a test can hand it the real envelope shape and watch the wrong one
 * come back null. `null` means the read FAILED — "I could not check" and "it
 * was not delivered" are different findings and only one of them blames the
 * party line.
