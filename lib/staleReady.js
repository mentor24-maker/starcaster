/**
 * staleReady — whose hands does a stuck `Ready to launch` ticket actually need?
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-09-01, task 86bbqp68c)
 *
 * 86bbkw1mn sat in `Ready to launch` for six days with Dane's merge approval
 * already given. It was never waiting on him. The merge step read his "merge"
 * at 02:16 on 2026-08-31, correctly declined because CI was red, said so —
 * and then nothing ever looked again. The red check was one failing test out
 * of 1,846, from a clean-merge rule collision with `main`. PR #444 the day
 * before was the same shape. Twice in one week makes it the normal failure
 * mode of this stage, not bad luck.
 *
 * The structural hole is that `Ready to launch` has no owner watching its CI.
 * The loops never touch it on purpose (it is operator-held, and
 * `busRelayPlan.js` leaves it out of the handback table deliberately), so the
 * merge step re-declines forever without ever escalating, and from Dane's side
 * a standing approval looks handled.
 *
 * THE PART THAT MATTERS IS NOT THE ALARM, IT IS THE ACTOR.
 *
 * `scripts/builder/pulse.js` already had a 24-hour threshold for this stage
 * and a bottleneck line that fired on it. When it fired it said:
 *
 *     Bottleneck: OPERATOR — N of M approved tickets have waited past 24h
 *     for a merge. The machine side is keeping up.
 *
 * In this incident that sentence is false in BOTH halves. The machine side was
 * not keeping up — CI was red — and it would have told Dane he was the blocker
 * when he was not. That is exactly what `docs/DOCTRINE.md` §2.5 was ratified
 * against: *whose hands does this need, and are they mine?* Naming the wrong
 * actor cost four days on ticket 86bbmfc15. The pulse could not do better,
 * because it never read GitHub check state at all — it reasoned from ClickUp
 * status and `date_updated`, which structurally cannot separate "waiting on
 * Dane" from "waiting on a red build".
 *
 * So this module's job is NOT to chase Dane. It is to answer "whose hands does
 * this need" honestly, and the most valuable thing it can ever say is
 * *"not yours."*
 *
 * PURE, AND TESTED AS SUCH. No network, no clock, no filesystem. The IO —
 * ClickUp, `gh`, the suppression stamps and the bus post — lives in
 * `scripts/stale_ready.mjs`, exactly the split `lib/loopThroughput.js` uses.

 * *"Yes -> tickets carrying your merge comment get a short fuse (1-2h)"*).
 *
 * 86bbqw49y sat in `Ready to launch` for TWELVE hours with its PR already
 * merged and the work already live. This check was awake and pointed straight
 * at it, and reported "0 past 24h / Nothing is stuck" — honestly, because 12
 * is less than 24. Cadence was never the problem: the threshold was measuring
 * the wrong thing.
 *
 * An untouched ticket in this stage can reasonably have 24 hours. A ticket
 * carrying an explicit `merge` from Dane is a DIFFERENT OBJECT: he has stated
 * an expectation, and the clock has to start where he stated it.
 *
 * WHY TWO HOURS AND NOT A NEW NUMBER. It is read from the pulse's `building`
 * threshold rather than typed here, because his ruling asked for exactly that
 * — "no new constant enters the codebase without a sibling", so an
 * approved-but-unmerged ticket gets the same patience the system already
 * extends to a build in flight. The coupling is deliberate and it is checked:
 * `staleReady.test.js` pins BOTH the value and the sibling, so retuning the
 * build threshold fails a test with this comment attached rather than silently

 * while it sat stuck. A clock reading ticket age would have been reset by the
 * refusals it exists to catch (Dane's ruling names this as the break test).
 *
 * Two rules, both deliberate:
 *
 *  - **The OLDEST live merge comment, not the newest.** If he says "merge",
 *    is ignored, and says it again, the wait began the first time. Starting
 *    over each time he repeats himself would reward the failure by moving the
 *    alarm further away.
 *  - **Live means newer than the current review verdict.** A merge command
 *    that predates the newest verdict authorized an EARLIER round — the merge
 *    step refuses it for exactly that reason — so a ticket rebuilt after a
 *    send-back does not arrive back in this stage already on fire from an
 *    approval that no longer applies. Such a ticket genuinely is waiting on a
 *    new word from him, which is what the 24h clock and row 1 already say.
