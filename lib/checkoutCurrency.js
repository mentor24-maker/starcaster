/**
 * Is this machine actually running the code on `main`, and if not, can it fix
 * itself?
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-09-01, task 86bbrf2vf). The Mac Mini could not update
 * itself for hours and said so only to a log file nobody reads. Three
 * untracked files left behind by the weekly-report job became tracked paths in
 * a later commit, and from that moment every fast-forward failed:
 *
 *   error: The following untracked working tree files would be overwritten by
 *   merge: docs/reports/2026-08-30.data.json ...
 *
 * It was found by hand, only because a fix was being pushed to it and somebody
 * happened to watch the pull.
 *
 * THE TIMIDITY WAS NEVER THE PROBLEM. `scripts/run_bus_relay.sh` updates only
 * on main, only with a clean tree, only fast-forward — "a background job may
 * keep a checkout current; it may not rewrite someone's work to do it." That
 * rule is right and is preserved here exactly.
 *
 * Two things were wrong, and both are about what happens AFTER the refusal:
 *
 *   1. Every refusal was an `echo` and nothing else. Everything else in this
 *      system posts to the bus when it goes wrong — the failure alert, the
 *      heartbeat watchdog, the throughput check. A machine running last
 *      week's rules looked exactly like a machine running this week's.
 *
 *   2. THE REASON PRINTED WAS WRONG. The blocked-by-untracked-files case fell
 *      through to "main has diverged from origin and only a person should sort
 *      that out." `main` had not diverged; it was a clean fast-forward blocked
 *      by three generated files. Anyone who did read the log would go hunting
 *      for a divergence that does not exist — the wrong-actor defect of
 *      DOCTRINE 2.5, wearing a different hat.
 *
 * WHY A STALE CHECKOUT DOES NOT ANNOUNCE ITSELF. The loop runner executes
 * `npm run clickup -- ...` from this checkout, while the loop skills build in
 * worktrees cut from a fresh `origin/main`. So a stale machine does not break.
 * It runs yesterday's tooling against today's code, quietly. The relay also
 * reads `lib/nodeRoles.js` — who may run what — out of this same checkout,
 * which is the case the update step was written for in the first place.
 */

/**
 * The states a checkout can be in. `alarm` is the only field that decides
 * whether the bus hears about it.
 *
 * ALARM ONLY WHEN THE MACHINE IS ACTUALLY RUNNING STALE CODE AND CANNOT FIX
 * ITSELF. A dirty tree or a feature branch on a checkout that is level with
 * `main` is somebody working, not a fault — announcing it every six hours
 * would be exactly the wallpaper that makes the real alarm unreadable. The
 * harm being watched for is running old code, so `behind === 0` is never an
 * alarm however untidy the folder is.
