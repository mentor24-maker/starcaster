# Work Log

Plain-English record of work shipped through the development loop
(spec → build → review → merge). Newest first. One entry per merged pull
request, written for a non-programmer: what changed and why it mattered.

This file is maintained automatically — each task's PR adds its own entry as
part of the change, so the log lands on `main` at the same moment the work does.
See `docs/LOOP_ENGINEERING.md` for how the loop works.

**Scope:** loop-shipped work only. Work done by hand in a normal session is not
here — so a quiet stretch in this log means the loop was idle, not that nothing
was built. The log starts when the loop did.

## 2026-08-18 — A place for visitors to report a broken page (#341)

First of five pieces building the in-app Bug Report tool. This one is
plumbing only — no button anyone can click yet (that's a later piece) — but
it lays a safe place to send reports to. Any tenant site can now POST a bug
report (what's wrong, what page, who reported it) to a new endpoint, which
checks the report isn't spam, isn't absurdly long, and isn't falsely claiming
to come from a signed-in staff member before saving it. Each report is kept
strictly to the site that reported it, matching the rule every other table
in this database follows. Nothing changes yet for anyone using the app.

## 2026-08-18 — Urgent is now yours alone to hand out (#347)

The task queue is sorted so the most urgent, oldest work is always done
first — which only works as a way for you to jump the line if nothing else
can also mark something Urgent. Loop tasks now file at High or below by
default, and an agent trying to set something to Urgent gets refused with a
plain explanation, unless it can point to you having actually asked for it.
Nothing about how the queue itself sorts or how tasks get claimed changed —
this only closes off who is allowed to reach for the top priority.

## 2026-08-18 — Test coverage for the "no more polls" message picker (#348)

The small piece of code that decides what message a player sees when
they've run out of polls to answer (wrong category, ran out of preferred
categories, none published at all, etc.) had no test coverage. Added tests
locking in that every one of those seven situations shows its own message
rather than a blank or a generic one, and that an unrecognized situation
still shows something sensible instead of nothing. No behavior changed —
this only makes sure the existing behavior can't quietly break later.

## 2026-08-18 — Shipping cleanly no longer LOOKS like it broke (#346)

Merging a finished piece of work with `npm run ship` was printing a scary
red error at the very end, even when everything genuinely worked — the
error came from a GitHub tool trying to also switch this computer's local
copy off the branch it just deleted, which never works from the kind of
folder every piece of work here happens in, and never mattered anyway,
since a separate step already handles that cleanup properly. That tool call
is now told to skip the part that always failed and never did anything
useful. A successful ship now looks like what it is — clean — and, just as
important, still reports a real failure honestly when one actually happens.

## 2026-08-18 — Test coverage for the gallery badge helpers (#351)

The Media Gallery module marks certain images as "badges" — reward symbols —
either through an explicit flag on the item or through a media type label
(current or an older, legacy spelling). This adds tests locking in that
detection: the canonical and legacy labels are both recognized (whitespace
and all), an empty or blank type resolves to "no opinion" rather than false,
and an item counts as a badge if *either* its flag or its media type says so.
No production code changed — this is test coverage only, written against the
existing helper functions in `lib/builder-client/gallery-media-badge-type.ts`.

## 2026-08-18 — The loops get their own door into ClickUp

The build and review loops used to reach ClickUp through the claude.ai
connector, which has a shared usage allowance that every agent session drains
together — when it ran out, the loops went blind and work stopped, twice in two
days. Now the loops talk to ClickUp directly (`npm run clickup`) using the
project's own key, kept in the Doppler vault and never seen by any agent. The
new commands cover the whole loop: list the queue sorted so the first line is
always the right task to take, claim a task safely so two loops can never grab
the same one, read a task and its comments, move statuses with the handoff to
Dane handled automatically, and comment — every write verified by reading the
result back, so a save that silently didn't stick is impossible to mistake for
a success. Also fixed a trap where the skills wrote down the Starcaster *space*
id where the Loop Queue *list* id belonged, which ClickUp punishes with an
unrelated-sounding "Team not authorized" error — the ids now live in one
place, `docs/LOOP_ENGINEERING.md`.

## 2026-07-28 — Safety check for "local dev mode" detection (#52)

Added automated tests around the small piece of code that decides whether the
app is running on your local machine versus the live site. The logic itself
didn't change — the tests just lock in its behavior so a future edit can't
break it silently. First real task run through the development loop as a test
flight. No visible change to any website.

## 2026-07-28 — Set up the development loop (#51)

Built the "loop" system that lets AI agents pick up small tasks, build each one
in isolation, check it, and open it for your approval — the spec → build →
review workflow. Adds three reusable skills plus an operator guide
(`docs/LOOP_ENGINEERING.md`). Nothing about the live product changed; this is
the machinery we now use to ship the work below.
