# Loop Engineering on Starcaster

A "loop" is a standing instruction to the AI: **keep doing the next task on a
list, over and over, without me prompting each time.** You spend a few minutes
in the morning describing what you want; the agents build it, review it, and
open pull requests all day; you come back and merge the good ones.

This doc is the operator's guide. The three skills that make it run live in
`.claude/skills/loop-spec`, `.claude/skills/loop-build`, and
`.claude/skills/loop-review`. That path is not decorative: Claude Code only
discovers skills under `.claude/skills/`, so a skill parked anywhere else
cannot be invoked by name and `/loop 30m loop-build` fails to find it.

## The three steps

| Step | Skill | What it does | Who does it |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Spec | `loop-spec` | Interviews you, turns an idea into small, well-scoped ClickUp tasks with acceptance criteria | You + agent (your only manual step) |
| 2. Build | `loop-build` | Picks the next task, builds it in its own worktree, passes all build gates, opens a PR | Agent, on a loop |
| 3. Review | `loop-review` | Independently verifies each PR, then pings you to merge — or sends it back with notes | Agent, on a loop |

The task list lives in a ClickUp list called **"Loop Queue"** in the
**Starcaster** space. Tasks move through statuses:
`todo → building → review → approved → merged` (plus `blocked` when a task
needs a human).

## How to run it

Two commands, each in **its own worktree** (a separate folder + branch so the
loops never step on each other — this is the #1 safety rule):

```
# In session/worktree A:
/loop 30m loop-build

# In session/worktree B:
/loop 30m loop-review
```

`/loop 30m X` means "run X, then run it again every 30 minutes." Build drains
the `todo` pile into PRs; review drains the `review` pile into `approved` PRs
that ping you.

Your day:
1. **Morning:** run `loop-spec`, answer its questions, approve the task list.
2. **During the day:** the loops build and review. You get a message per
   approved PR with a preview link and test steps.
3. **When you're ready:** tell CC "merge PR #NN" and it merges (only with all
   checks green). Merging stays manual on purpose — see Safety.

## The work log — a plain-English record

Every task's PR also adds one dated, plain-English entry to `docs/WORK-LOG.md`
(newest first) — written for a non-programmer: what changed and why it mattered.
Because the entry rides inside the task's own PR, the log updates on `main` at
the exact moment the work merges; nothing edits `WORK-LOG.md` directly. Scroll
that one file any day to read, in English, everything the loops have shipped.

## Safety — why this is wired tighter than the YouTube version

The popular "just wake up and hit merge" demos run on throwaway apps. Starcaster
is different, so the loops have guardrails baked in:

- **`main` auto-deploys to production.** So no loop ever merges on its own. The
  review loop can only mark a PR `approved`; **you** authorize the merge.
- **Every loop runs in its own worktree.** Two agents in one folder clobber
  each other's files — the single most common way this repo breaks. The build
  skill creates a fresh worktree per task automatically.
- **Every build passes the full gate set before a PR opens** — `typecheck`,
  the builder tests, the conventions check, the syntax check, and the rebuild
  command for any generated file. A task that can't pass gets marked `blocked`
  for a human instead of shipping broken.
- **Review is independent.** It re-runs everything and actually opens the page
  in a browser; it never rubber-stamps the build loop.

## Cost — the part the demos skip

A loop is an agent running continuously, so it spends tokens whether the output
is good or not. Start with **one** loop on **low-risk, self-checking work**
(e.g. test coverage) to confirm the value, then widen. Don't run six loops on
day one.

## First-time setup checklist

1. Create the **"Loop Queue"** list in the Starcaster ClickUp space.
2. In the ClickUp UI, set its statuses to:
   `todo → building → review → approved → blocked → merged`.
3. Merge the branch that adds these three skills so they're available on `main`.
4. Do a **dry run:** spec 1–2 tiny test-coverage tasks, run one `loop-build`
   pass, watch it produce a clean PR, then run one `loop-review` pass. Only
   after that cycle works should you trust it with real feature work.

## Good first applications (ranked by safety)

- 🟢 **Test-coverage backfill** — self-verifying, tiny blast radius. Best first.
- 🟢 **Editor-form standardization** — one module per task; wants many passes.
- 🟢 **Mobile-responsive pass** across modules — same repetitive shape.
- 🟡 **Module manufacturing** — great, but watch the dual-registration landmine.
- 🟡 **Vanilla-JS → React migration** — huge and repetitive, but `public/js/`
  is fragile; needs the heaviest review. A later-phase target.
